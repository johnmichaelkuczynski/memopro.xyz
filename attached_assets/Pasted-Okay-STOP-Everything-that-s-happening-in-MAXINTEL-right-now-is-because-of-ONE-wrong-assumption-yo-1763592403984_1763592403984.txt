Okay — STOP.
Everything that’s happening in MAXINTEL right now is because of ONE wrong assumption your agent is making:

❌ It thinks “ZHI API” is some external service with complex HMAC signing rules.
❌ It thinks the /zhi/query endpoint requires 4 special headers.
❌ It thinks it needs timestamp, nonce, app-id, and a special signature format.

That’s all completely wrong
because YOU OWN analyticphilosophy.net AND YOU CONTROL ITS ENDPOINT.

There is NO external “ZHI company.”
There is NO special SDK.
There are NO required headers like nonce or timestamp.
There is NO complex HMAC signature format.

Your own app invented those because it hallucinated them.

Your actual AP endpoint uses the same simple auth your other apps use:

✅ Authorization: Bearer ${ZHI_PRIVATE_KEY}

Not 4 headers.
Not HMAC.
Not nonce.
Not timestamp.

🔥 HERE IS THE FIX

You will tell the Replit agent in AnalyticPhilosophy.net:

The internal ZHI endpoint uses simple Bearer authentication, not HMAC, not app-id, not nonce, and not timestamp.
The only required header must be:
Authorization: Bearer ${ZHI_PRIVATE_KEY}

Remove any extra authentication requirements.
The MAXINTEL client will send plain JSON and that one header only.

Then tell the Replit agent in MAXINTEL (askintel):

Remove all HMAC logic, timestamp, nonce, and signature code.
Connect to AnalyticPhilosophy.net using:

POST https://analyticphilosophy.net/zhi/query

with EXACTLY this header:
Authorization: Bearer ${ZHI_PRIVATE_KEY}

and a JSON body like:
{ "query": "...", "author": "...", "limit": 5 }

Nothing else is needed.
No signature.
No hashing.
No extra headers.

If the toggle is OFF, skip calling that endpoint.

🚨 WHY YOUR MAXINTEL APP IS MAKING FAKE QUOTES

Because the agent never succeeded in calling analyticphilosophy.net at all.

It kept failing the signature
➡ so it silently fell back to default LLM behavior
➡ and produced hallucinated quotes.

Fix the authentication
➡ MAXINTEL will use ANALYTICPHILOSOPHY
➡ and the hallucinated quotes will stop instantly.

📌 I WILL NOW GIVE YOU THE EXACT SENTENCES TO PASTE TO EACH AGENT
To the AnalyticPhilosophy agent:

Change the /zhi/query endpoint to use only simple Bearer token authentication.
The only required header is:
Authorization: Bearer ${ZHI_PRIVATE_KEY}

Remove all requirements for HMAC signatures, nonce, timestamp, or additional headers.

To the MAXINTEL agent:

Remove all HMAC signing, hashing, nonce, timestamp, and X-ZHI headers.
The AnalyticPhilosophy endpoint uses simple Bearer auth only.

Implement the connection as:

POST https://analyticphilosophy.net/zhi/query

Headers:
Authorization: Bearer ${ZHI_PRIVATE_KEY}
Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{ "query": "...", "author": "...", "limit": 10 }

Respect the user toggle. When OFF: skip external calls.
