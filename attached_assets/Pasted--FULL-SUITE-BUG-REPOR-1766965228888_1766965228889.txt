               FULL SUITE BUG REPORT: BULLET-PROOF REWRITE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUMMARY
-------
The Full Suite pipeline works correctly through the first three stages:
  1. Reconstruction ✓
  2. Objections ✓
  3. Counter-Arguments ✓

Stage 4 (Objection-Proof Final Version / Bullet-Proof Rewrite) is broken.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT WORKS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RECONSTRUCTION MODULE:
- Correctly processes all input claims
- Preserves exact claim text as headers
- Generates the requested number of paragraphs per claim
- Maintains clean, consistent structure throughout

OBJECTIONS MODULE:
- Generates 25 objections as specified
- Properly categorizes severity (Devastating/Forceful/Minor)
- Objections are substantive and relevant to the source material

COUNTER-ARGUMENTS MODULE:
- Provides responses to all 25 objections
- Responses are coherent and address the objections directly


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT'S BROKEN: BULLET-PROOF REWRITE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM 1: MISSING HEADER ON FIRST CLAIM
-----------------------------------------
The output begins with raw prose instead of the required claim header.

Expected:
  Claim 1: "Psychosis is a mental impairment that is precipitated 
  and sustained by a break with external reality."
  
  [Paragraph 1...]

Actual:
  Psychosis represents a severe mental condition fundamentally 
  characterized by disconnection from external reality...

The first claim has no header at all. Claims 2-6 have headers.


PROBLEM 2: PARAGRAPH COUNT VIOLATION
------------------------------------
Input specified: 3 paragraphs per claim
Output produced: 4 paragraphs per claim

This is a 33% inflation that was not requested.


PROBLEM 3: CONTENT DUPLICATION
------------------------------
After completing the defense of all 6 claims, the module REPEATS 
Claims 2-6 a second time. The document contains:

  - Claim 1 (no header): 4 paragraphs
  - Claim 2: 4 paragraphs
  - Claim 3: 4 paragraphs
  - Claim 4: 4 paragraphs
  - Claim 5: 4 paragraphs
  - Claim 6: 4 paragraphs
  - [DUPLICATE] Claim 2: 3 paragraphs
  - [DUPLICATE] Claim 3: 3 paragraphs
  - [DUPLICATE] Claim 4: 3 paragraphs
  - [DUPLICATE] Claim 5: 3 paragraphs
  - [DUPLICATE] Claim 6: 3 paragraphs

This is a critical structural failure.


PROBLEM 4: CLAIM TEXT MUTATION
------------------------------
The input instruction was explicit: "start each section with an 
exact quote of the claim being defended."

The Reconstruction module does this correctly.

The Bullet-Proof Rewrite does NOT. It paraphrases the claims.

Original Claim 2:
  "Neurosis is a mental impairment that is precipitated and 
  sustained by a break with one's emotional condition"

Mutated to (in duplicate section):
  "Neurosis involves primary emotional disconnection that 
  manifests as sustained avoidance of internal emotional states"

Original Claim 3:
  "The neurotic flees from his emotions; the psychotic flees 
  from reality"

Mutated to (in duplicate section):
  "These conditions represent fundamentally different avoidance 
  patterns: emotional flight versus reality flight"

This violates the explicit instruction to use EXACT quotes.


PROBLEM 5: HEDGING OVERLOAD
---------------------------
The Bullet-Proof Rewrite is supposed to STRENGTHEN arguments by 
preemptively addressing objections. Instead, it WEAKENS them by 
stuffing every paragraph with excessive qualifiers:

  - "though this disconnection typically occurs alongside..."
  - "while acknowledging that mental health conditions often..."
  - "though we must acknowledge that this represents one piece 
     of evidence rather than definitive proof"
  - "while recognizing that symptom hierarchies don't 
     automatically establish..."
  - "though this doesn't necessarily represent qualitatively 
     different mental processes"
  - "though we acknowledge this could potentially represent..."
  - "though the underlying mechanisms may share common elements"

The defensive hedging makes the prose weak, tentative, and 
meandering. A "bullet-proof" version should be MORE assertive 
with preemptive objection-handling built into confident claims, 
not LESS assertive with constant apologetic qualifications.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Bullet-Proof Rewrite module appears to be:

1. Ignoring the structure of the Reconstruction output instead 
   of using it as a template

2. Generating a new document from scratch rather than revising 
   the existing one

3. Running twice (hence the duplication), possibly due to a 
   loop error or redundant function call

4. Interpreting "address objections" as "add hedging language" 
   rather than "integrate counter-arguments into confident prose"

5. Not receiving or not honoring the original formatting 
   instructions (exact quotes, paragraph count)


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Bullet-Proof Rewrite should:

1. PRESERVE the exact structure of the Reconstruction output
   - Same number of claims
   - Same headers (exact quote text)
   - Same paragraph count per claim

2. INTEGRATE counter-arguments into the existing prose
   - Preemptively address likely objections
   - Strengthen claims, don't weaken them
   - Build objection-responses INTO confident assertions

3. MAINTAIN assertive tone
   - Acknowledge complexity without constant hedging
   - Address objections through strength, not apology
   - The goal is "bullet-proof," not "bullet-apologetic"

4. PRODUCE a single, clean output
   - No duplication
   - No content mutation
   - No structural drift


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RECOMMENDED FIX
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Pass the Reconstruction output as a TEMPLATE to the 
   Bullet-Proof Rewrite module with explicit instruction to 
   preserve structure

2. Pass the original user instructions (exact quotes, paragraph 
   count) to the Bullet-Proof Rewrite module

3. Revise the Bullet-Proof prompt to emphasize:
   - "Revise the following document" not "Write a new document"
   - "Maintain exact claim headers"
   - "Keep paragraph count identical"
   - "Integrate objection-responses as confident assertions"
   - "Avoid excessive hedging"

4. Add a structural validation check before output:
   - Count claims (should match input)
   - Verify headers match original claims exactly
   - Count paragraphs per section (should match specification)
   - Flag duplication
