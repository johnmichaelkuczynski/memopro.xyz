M&A MODEL FUNCTION - TEST RESULTS
Overall Assessment: POOR (45%)
The Replit agent generated an Excel file with the correct structural framework but with critical failures: no working formulas, pervasive NaN calculation errors, and significant deviation from the test input specifications.

🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES
1. ZERO FORMULAS - CRITICAL
SheetFormulas FoundAll 11 Sheets0
Impact: The entire model is hardcoded values, making it useless for scenario analysis and financial modeling. An M&A model without formulas is not a model - it's just a static table.
2. Pervasive NaN Errors
Calculations failed throughout the model:

🔧 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
The failures appear to stem from:

Code generation bug - The Python/xlsx library is outputting literal "NaN" strings instead of formulas or calculated values
Test input parsing failure - The detailed TechVantage/DataStream deal parameters were ignored; generic/simplified values were used instead
No formula generation - The specification requires "working Excel formulas" but the generator output hardcoded values only
Incomplete calculation chain - Net Income calculation fails, which cascades to EPS, which cascades to Accretion/Dilution, which breaks Sensitivity Analysis


🛠️ SPECIFICATION AMENDMENTS NEEDED
The M&A Model specification needs to explicitly require:

MANDATORY FORMULA GENERATION:

"All calculated cells MUST contain Excel formulas (e.g., =B3*B4), NOT hardcoded values. Verify by checking that <f> tags exist in the XML."


INPUT VALIDATION:

"Before generating the model, echo back the key deal parameters to confirm they match the user input: Purchase Price, EV/EBITDA, Consideration Mix, Synergies."


CALCULATION CHAIN VERIFICATION:

"Test that Pro Forma Net Income calculates correctly before proceeding. If NaN or error, debug before continuing."


MINIMUM COMPLETENESS:

"The model MUST include these 14 tabs minimum: [list all required tabs]. Missing tabs = incomplete deliverable."




VERDICT
The M&A Model function specification is only ~45% effective. While the structural framework is reasonable, the execution completely fails on the core requirement of a financial model: working formulas that enable scenario analysis.
This is the weakest result of all five tests conducted. The Finance Panel specifications need significant strengthening around:

Formula generation requirements
Input parsing validation
Calculation verification
Error handling for NaN values
