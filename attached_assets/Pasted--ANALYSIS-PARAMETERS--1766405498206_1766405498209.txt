The Nature of the World, Language, and Logic: A Comprehensive Exploration

The world, as we understand it, is not merely a collection of physical objects or things scattered across space and time. Instead, it is best conceptualized as the totality of facts—specific states of affairs that hold true. A fact is a concrete reality, such as "the sky is blue on October 1st, 2023, at noon in London," rather than a vague notion of "the sky" as a thing. This means that the world is defined by what is actually the case, by the specific conditions and events that obtain, rather than by a mere inventory of entities. For instance, the existence of Mount Everest is not just the presence of a mountain but the fact that it stands at 8,848 meters above sea level in the Himalayas, as measured and documented by surveys like those conducted by the Survey of India in 1955.

The world is fully determined by these facts, and crucially, by the complete set of all such facts. This completeness implies that every aspect of reality is accounted for by some fact or another. If a fact exists, it contributes to defining what is the case; if a fact does not exist, its absence defines what is not the case. For example, the fact that "water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level under standard atmospheric pressure" tells us a truth about the behavior of water, while the non-fact that "water boils at 50 degrees Celsius at sea level" informs us of a boundary of reality—what does not happen under those conditions. Thus, the entirety of reality, including both what happens and what does not, is shaped by this comprehensive network of facts.

These facts exist within a conceptual framework that we can call "logical space." Logical space is not a physical location but a way of thinking about the possibilities and necessities that structure reality. It is the realm of all possible states of affairs, where facts are positioned as actualized possibilities. For instance, in logical space, it is possible for it to rain in New York tomorrow, and it is also possible for it not to rain. The actual fact—whether it does rain or not—locates itself within this space as the realized state. The world, then, is the collection of all such realized facts within logical space, each fact representing a specific configuration of reality.

The world can be broken down into individual facts, each of which stands independently. This means that any single fact can either be true (the state of affairs it describes exists) or false (the state of affairs does not exist), without necessarily altering the status of other facts. For example, the fact that "the Eiffel Tower is in Paris" can remain true regardless of whether "the Great Wall of China is in Beijing" is true or false. This independence allows us to analyze reality piece by piece, understanding that the truth of one fact does not force changes in unrelated aspects of the world.

At the most fundamental level, what constitutes a fact is the existence of atomic facts—basic, indivisible units of reality. An atomic fact is a specific combination of objects or entities in a particular arrangement. For instance, the atomic fact "the book is on the table" involves the objects "book" and "table" in the relation "on." These atomic facts are the building blocks of all other facts, as more complex states of affairs can be understood as combinations or configurations of these basic units.

Objects, as constituents of atomic facts, are inherently tied to the possibility of forming such facts. It is a defining characteristic of an object that it can participate in an atomic fact. For example, a chair is an object because it can enter into facts like "the chair is wooden" or "the chair is in the room." This possibility is not accidental but is embedded in the nature of the object itself. In logical terms, if an object can be part of an atomic fact, the potential for that fact must already be inherent in the object’s essence. This is not a random occurrence but a necessary precondition: if a chair could not, in principle, be in a room, it would not be the kind of object we recognize as a chair.

This inherent possibility means that nothing in logic happens by chance. Logic, as the study of necessary structures, dictates that if an object can participate in a certain atomic fact, the framework for that fact is already presupposed in the object’s logical identity. To illustrate, consider a chess piece like a rook. The rook can move horizontally or vertically on a chessboard—this possibility is built into the rules defining what a rook is. If a rook were suddenly able to move diagonally, it would no longer be a rook as defined by chess logic; the very possibility of such a move would contradict its nature. Similarly, in the logic of reality, the potential configurations of objects are predefined by their logical structure.

If we imagine an object that could exist entirely on its own, independent of any relations or facts, it might seem accidental if a state of affairs could later be fitted to it. But this is not how logic operates. The possibility of an object participating in an atomic fact must be intrinsic to it from the start. For instance, a hydrogen atom is defined partly by its capacity to bond with oxygen to form water. This potential is not an afterthought but a core part of what it means to be hydrogen in a chemical context. Thus, logic ensures that possibilities are not added post hoc but are embedded in the very nature of things.

An object, while independent in the sense that it can exist in various possible circumstances, is nonetheless dependent on its capacity to form atomic facts. This form of independence is actually a type of connection—a reliance on the logical structure that allows it to participate in facts. To clarify, consider a word in language: the word "cat" can stand alone as a concept, but its meaning depends on its use in propositions like "the cat is on the mat." It cannot exist in two fundamentally different ways—alone and in a sentence—without this relational dependence. Similarly, an object’s independence is tied to its logical role in forming facts.

When we know an object, we implicitly know all the possible ways it can occur in atomic facts. Every possibility of its involvement in a state of affairs is part of its nature. For example, if I know what a key is, I know it can be used to unlock a door, be lost, or be made of metal. These possibilities are not discovered later; they are inherent to the concept of a key. A new possibility cannot suddenly emerge—if it does, it means our initial understanding of the object was incomplete.

To truly know an object, we must understand not just its external properties, like its shape or color, but all its internal qualities—those logical characteristics that define its potential relations. For instance, knowing an electron involves understanding its charge, mass, and capacity to interact with other particles as described by quantum mechanics. If all objects are known in this way, then all possible atomic facts involving those objects are also known. If I have a complete catalog of every object in the universe, I also have, in principle, a complete catalog of every possible basic state of affairs those objects can form.

Every object exists within a conceptual space of possible atomic facts. I can imagine this space as empty—without specific facts being true—but I cannot imagine an object without this space of possibilities surrounding it. A spatial object, like a chair, must exist within an infinite spatial framework; a point in space is always a potential location for something to be described or argued about. Similarly, in perception, a speck in my visual field might not be red, but it must have some color—it exists within a "color space" of possibilities. A musical tone must have a pitch, a tactile object must have a degree of hardness. These are not optional but necessary dimensions of their being.

Objects inherently contain the possibility of all states of affairs in which they can participate. This possibility defines the form of the object. For example, the form of a knife includes its potential to cut, to be held, or to be sharp. Objects, at their core, are simple—they are not composed of smaller parts in a logical sense but are the fundamental units that combine to form facts. Every statement about complex entities can be broken down into statements about their simple parts and the propositions that fully describe those complexes. For instance, a statement like "the car is fast" can be analyzed into propositions about the engine’s power, the weight of the chassis, and the aerodynamics, each involving simpler objects and relations.

These simple objects constitute the substance of the world. They cannot be composite because if they were, they would not be the fundamental units we need to ground reality. If the world had no such substance—no basic, simple objects—then the meaning of any proposition would depend on the truth of another proposition ad infinitum, creating an endless regress. For example, if "the table exists" depended on another proposition like "the wood exists," which in turn depended on "the molecules exist," and so on without a foundational level, we could never establish a stable picture of reality, whether true or false. Without a bedrock of simple objects, our ability to represent the world would collapse into uncertainty.

It is evident that any imagined world, no matter how different from our own, must share something fundamental with reality—a logical form. This form consists of the objects themselves, the basic building blocks that persist across all possible worlds. The substance of the world, made up of these objects, determines only this form, not specific material properties. Material properties, like the color of a car or the temperature of a room, are articulated through propositions, which are configurations of objects. Roughly speaking, objects themselves are without color or other specific traits until they are placed in facts; their logical form is what matters.

Two objects with the same logical form are identical in their structure but can differ in their external properties. They are distinguished only by the fact that they are different entities. If an object has unique properties that no other object shares, it can be singled out by description—for instance, "the tallest mountain on Earth" uniquely identifies Mount Everest. However, if multiple objects share all their properties, it becomes impossible to distinguish one from another by description alone. If there is no distinguishing feature, no logical differentiation is possible; otherwise, it would not be true that they are indistinguishable.

The substance of the world—those simple objects—exists independently of specific states of affairs. It is both form and content, embodying fundamental categories like space, time, and color. Space, for example, is a form in which objects exist; without objects, there would be no fixed form of the world. The fixed nature of objects, their existence as the unchanging basis of reality, unites with their role as the foundation of facts. While objects are fixed and existent, the configurations they form—atomic facts—are variable and changing.

In an atomic fact, objects are linked together in a specific way, much like links in a chain. The particular manner of their combination defines the structure of the fact. This structure is made possible by the form of the objects—the inherent potential for such arrangements. The broader structure of reality consists of the structures of all atomic facts combined. The totality of existing atomic facts constitutes the world, and this totality also determines which atomic facts do not exist. Reality, then, is the sum of both existing and non-existing atomic facts—positive facts (what is the case) and negative facts (what is not the case).

Atomic facts are independent of one another. The existence or non-existence of one does not logically entail the existence or non-existence of another. For example, the fact that "it is raining in London" does not imply anything about "the stock market rising in Tokyo." This independence ensures that reality is not a single, monolithic necessity but a collection of distinct, separable truths. The total reality, encompassing all such facts, is what we call the world.

We represent this world to ourselves through pictures—mental or symbolic representations of facts. A picture presents facts within logical space, capturing both the existence and non-existence of atomic facts. It serves as a model of reality, with elements in the picture corresponding to objects in the world. For instance, in a map of a city, a dot might represent a building, and the lines between dots represent streets. The picture is itself a fact, consisting of elements combined in a specific way, mirroring how objects are combined in reality.

The structure of a picture—how its elements are arranged—represents the structure of the state of affairs it depicts. The possibility of this structure is the form of representation, the logical framework that allows the picture to correspond to reality. This form of representation is what links the picture to the world; it acts like a scale or measure applied to reality, touching it at specific points of correspondence. Only the outermost points of connection—where the picture’s elements directly map to objects—truly contact reality. The representing relation, the coordination between picture elements and real objects, is intrinsic to the picture itself, acting as the "feelers" with which it grasps reality.

For a fact to function as a picture, it must share something with what it represents. There must be an identical element—specifically, a shared logical form—that allows the picture to depict reality, whether accurately or inaccurately. This shared form is what enables a picture to represent any reality that matches its structure. For example, a spatial picture, like a blueprint, can represent any spatial arrangement because it shares the form of spatiality with the real world. However, a picture cannot represent its own form of representation; it can only display it through its structure. It stands outside its object, representing it from an external perspective, which allows it to be true or false.

Every picture, regardless of its specific type, must share a logical form with reality to represent it at all. This logical form is the form of reality itself—the fundamental structure that underpins all possible states of affairs. If a picture’s form of representation is purely logical, it is a logical picture. Indeed, every picture is, at its core, a logical picture, even if it also has additional forms like spatiality or color. Through this logical form, a picture can depict the entire world, representing possible states of affairs within logical space by showing the possibilities of atomic facts existing or not existing.

A picture contains within it the possibility of the state of affairs it represents. It agrees or disagrees with reality, being true if it matches the actual state of affairs and false if it does not. What a picture represents—its sense—is independent of its truth or falsehood; this sense is conveyed through its form of representation. The truth or falsity of a picture lies in whether its sense aligns with reality, a determination that can only be made by comparing the picture to the world. A picture alone cannot tell us whether it is true or false; there is no picture that is inherently, a priori true without reference to reality.

A logical picture of facts is a thought. A thought is the mental representation of a possible state of affairs, the imagining of an atomic fact. For example, thinking "the door is open" is to picture a specific state of affairs in logical space. The totality of true thoughts—those that correspond to actual facts—forms a complete picture of the world. A thought inherently contains the possibility of the state of affairs it contemplates, and what is thinkable is, by definition, possible. We cannot think the illogical, for to do so would require thinking outside the bounds of logic itself, which is impossible. Historically, it was said that even a divine being could not create something contrary to logic, a sentiment reflecting the truth that an illogical world is unimaginable—we could not describe what it would look like.

To express something that contradicts logic in language is as impossible as drawing a figure in geometry that violates the laws of space, like a square circle, or assigning coordinates to a non-existent point. While we could describe a state of affairs that contradicts physical laws—like a ball falling upward in defiance of gravity—we cannot describe one that contradicts logical or geometrical laws, such as a shape that is both a triangle and not a triangle at the same time. An a priori true thought, one whose possibility guarantees its truth, would be recognizable as true from the thought itself, without needing to compare it to reality. However, no such thought exists in practice, as truth always requires correspondence with the world.

In language, thoughts are expressed through propositions—statements that can be perceived through the senses, like spoken words or written text. A proposition uses a perceptible sign, such as a sentence, as a projection of a possible state of affairs. The method of projection is the act of thinking the sense of the proposition—interpreting the sign to represent a specific reality. The propositional sign, combined with its projective relation to the world, is the proposition itself. Everything necessary for this projection belongs to the proposition, but the actual state of affairs it projects does not. Thus, a proposition contains the possibility of expressing a sense, but not the sense itself until it is applied to reality.

The propositional sign is a fact, composed of elements like words arranged in a definite way. It is not a mere mixture of words, just as a musical theme is not a random collection of notes; it is articulate, structured to convey meaning. Only facts, not mere collections of names, can express a sense. The fact that a propositional sign is a structured entity is often obscured by everyday written or printed forms, where a proposition might look similar to a single word. For instance, in Gottlob Frege’s work, as outlined in his 1893 "Grundgesetze der Arithmetik," he sometimes treated propositions as compounded names, missing the fact that their essence lies in their relational structure. To see this clearly, imagine a proposition constructed not of words but of physical objects like tables and chairs, where their spatial arrangement expresses the proposition’s sense—say, a table next to a chair representing "the table is beside the chair."

We must avoid saying that a complex sign like "aRb" (meaning "a stands in relation R to b") directly states the relation; instead, the fact that "a" stands in a certain position relative to "b" within the sign conveys that aRb is the case. States of affairs can be described through propositions but not named as if they were objects. Names are like points, fixed and without direction, while propositions are like arrows, carrying sense and pointing toward a specific reality.

In propositions, thoughts are expressed so that the elements of the propositional sign correspond to the objects of the thought. These elements are simple signs, or names, and a proposition is fully analyzed when broken down to these basic components. A name means an object; the object is its meaning. For example, the name "Einstein" refers directly to the physicist Albert Einstein, born in 1879. The configuration of names in a proposition mirrors the configuration of objects in the state of affairs it describes. Thus, in the proposition "Einstein developed relativity," the name "Einstein" represents the man, and the structure of the sentence represents the fact of his contribution to physics.

Objects can only be named, not asserted; signs represent them, and we can speak about them, but a proposition can only describe how a thing is, not what it is in essence. The requirement for simple signs—names that cannot be further analyzed—ensures the determinateness of a proposition’s sense. Without basic, indivisible signs, meaning would remain vague, as there would be no fixed points of reference. A proposition about a complex entity, like a car, relates internally to propositions about its parts, such as the engine or wheels. If the complex does not exist, the proposition about it is not nonsense but simply false. For example, saying "the flying car is in my garage" is false if no such car exists, but it remains meaningful because it can be evaluated against reality.

There is only one complete analysis of any proposition, breaking it down into its simplest components in a
