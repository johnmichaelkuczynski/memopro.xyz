THE LBO ENGINE IS STILL COMPLETELY BROKEN.

The parser is perfect — the handoff into the model is dead.

This output gives us 100% diagnostic certainty.

Below is the full analysis in the simplest possible form.

🔥 1. Purchase Price is STILL undefined

You specified:

Entry EBITDA = 135M

Entry multiple = 7.5×

Purchase price should be 1,012.5M

The model output:

→ Purchase Price: undefinedM

This tells us:

The LBO engine is not reading the purchasePrice field at all.
🔥 2. Senior Debt STILL shows as $2,625M

This is the same exact failure signature as before.

Given:

Senior = 3.5× EBITDA

EBITDA = 135M

Correct senior debt = 472.5M

Your model shows:

→ $2,625M

Again:

The LBO engine is not reading seniorDebtMultiple from the parser.

It is using a garbage, stale, or default value.

🔥 3. Initial Equity appears as NEGATIVE $1,175M — impossible

Equity = Purchase price − Debt.

Correct equity:

1,012.5 − (472.5 + 108) = ~432M.

Your model:

→ –1,175M

This means:

Both purchase price and debt inputs are undefined → math collapses.
🔥 4. Entry Multiple changed from 7.5× to 3.5×

The output shows:

Entry Multiple: 3.5x


That was the senior leverage, not the entry multiple.

This means:

The model is confusing or overwriting fields — catastrophic structural bug.

Entry Multiple ≠ Senior Debt Multiple.
But the model is mixing them.

🔥 5. Exit EV = undefinedM → IRR and MOIC are fake

The IRR = 9.0% is not real.
It is computed from garbage values.

Any undefined inside the model produces:

undefined EV

undefined equity

undefined proceeds

fake IRR

This confirms:

The math engine is running with null inputs.
🔥 THE ROOT CAUSE IS 100% CONFIRMED:
✔ The parser is fixed.
❌ The LBO model is NOT connected to the parser output.

The model is still using:

No purchase price

No debt multiples

No hold period

No exit multiple

No transaction fees

No financing fees

Even though all of these ARE PARSED CORRECTLY.

This is not a modeling error.
This is not a math error.

This is a wiring / mapping error — the data never gets into the model.

✔ TELL THE REPLIT AGENT THIS EXACTLY:

Paste this:

THE LBO ENGINE IS NOT USING THE PARSED INPUTS.

Here is proof:

purchasePrice is parsed correctly but enters the model as undefined

seniorDebtMultiple and subDebtMultiple are parsed correctly but the model outputs impossible values (e.g., $2,625M instead of $472.5M)

entryMultiple is overwritten with seniorDebtMultiple (3.5×)

holdPeriod is parsed but appears as undefined

exitEV and exit equity both appear as undefined

all downstream values (equity, leverage, IRR) are wrong because the model is running with null inputs

Fix the mapping layer between parser output and the LBO model input object. Do NOT patch the model.
Fix the handoff.

✔ Once the agent really fixes it, we run LBO TEST #3.

Ask me for LBO Test #3 when ready.
