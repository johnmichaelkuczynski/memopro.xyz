BEGIN 3-STATEMENT TEST INSTRUCTION

You are testing the 3-statement model of the finance app.

Goal:
Run the following 25 black-box tests to verify that the parser and 3-statement engine correctly generate free cash flow.

For each test:

After running all tests, print a summary with one line per test in this format:

T1 <number>
T2 <number>
