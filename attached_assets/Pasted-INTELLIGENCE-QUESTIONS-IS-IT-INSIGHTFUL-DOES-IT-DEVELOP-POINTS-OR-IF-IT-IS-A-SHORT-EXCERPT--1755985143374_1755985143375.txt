INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONS

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

ORIGINALITIY QUESTIONS 

IS IT ORIGINAL (NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT IN THE SENSE THAT ONLY A FECUND MIND COULD COME UP WITH IT)? 
EXPLANATION OF LAST QUESTION: IF I PUT IN ISAAC NEWTON, IT SHOULD BE NOT BE DECRIBED AS 'UNORIGINAL' 
SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY (NAMELY, NEWTON) SAID IT HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.
ARE THE WAYS THE IDEAS ARE INTERCONNECTED ORIGINAL? OR ARE THOSE INTERCONNECTIONS CONVENTION-DRIVEN AND DOCTRINAIRE?
ARE IDEAS DEVELOPED IN A FRESH AND ORIGINAL WAY? OR IS THE IDEA-DEVELOPMENT MERELY ASSOCIATIVE, COMMONSENSE-BASED (OR COMMON-NONSENSE-BASED),
OR DOCTRINAIRE? 
IS IT ORIGINAL RELATIVE TO THE DATASET THAT, JUDGING BY WHAT IT SAYS AND HOW IT SAYS IT, IT APPEARS TO BE ADDRESSING? (THIS QUESTION IS MEANT TO RULE
OUT 'ORIGINALITY'-BENCHMARKS THAT AUTOMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE DARWIN, FREUD, NEWTON, GALILEO AS 'UNORIGINAL.') 
IS IT ORIGINAL IN A SUBSTANTIVE SENSE (IN THE SENSE IN WHICH BACH WAS ORIGINAL) OR ONLY IN A FRIVOLOUS TOKEN SENSE (THE SENSE IN WHICH SOMEBODY WHO 
RANDOMLY BANGS ON A PIANO IS 'ORIGINAL')? 
IF YOU GAVE A ROBOT THE DATASET TO WHICH THE PASSAGE IS A RESPON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT BUTCHER IDEAS, 
THIS BEING WHAT GIVES IT A SHEEN OF 'ORIGINALITY'?
IS IT BOILERPLATE (OR IF IT, PER SE, IS NOT BOILER PLATE, IS IT THE RESULT OF APPLYING BOILER PLATE PROTOCOLS IN A BOILER PLATE WAY TO SOME DATASET)?
WOULD SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT READ IT, BUT WAS OTHERWISE EDUCATED AND INFORMED, COME WAY FROM IT BEING MORE ENGLIGHTED AND BETTER EQUIPPED TO 
ADJUDICATE INTELLECTUAL QUESTIONS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD HE COME UP CONFUSED WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE TO SHOW FOR IT? 
WOULD SOMEBODY READING IT COME AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE WITH INSIGHTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HARD TO ACQUIRE THAT HOLD UP IN GENERAL? 
OR WOULD WHATEVER HIS TAKEAWAY WAS HAVE VALIDITY ONLY RELATIVE TO VALIDITIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO SOME AUTHOR OR SYSTEM AND PROBABLY DO NOT HAVE
MUCH OBJECTIVE LEGITIMACY? 

COGENCY QUESTIONS 
IS THE POINT BEING DEFENDED (IF THERE IS ONE) SHARP ENOUGH THAT IT DOES NOT NEED ARGUMENTATION? 
DOES THE REASONING DEFEND THE POINT BEING ARGUED IN THE RIGHT WAYS? 
DOES THE REASONING ONLY DEFEND THE ARGUED FOR POINT AGAINST STRAWMEN? 
DOES THE REASONING DEVELOP THE POINT PER SE? IE DOES THE REASONING SHOW THAT THE POINT ITSELF IS STRONG?
OR DOES IT 'DEFEND' IT ONLY BY SHOWING THAT VARIOUS AUTHORITIES DO OR WOULD APPROVE OF IT? 
IS THE POINT SHARP? IF NOT, IS IT SHARPLY DEFENDED? 
IS THE REASONING GOOD ONLY IN A TRIVIAL 'DEBATING' SENSE? OR IS IT GOOD IN THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD LIKELY MAKE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON 
RECONSIDER HIS POSITION?
IS THE REASONING INVOLVED IN DEFENDING THE KEY CLAIM ABOUT ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING THAT CLAIM? OR IS IT MORE ABOUT OBFUSCATING? 
DOES THE REASONING HELP ILLUMINATE THE MERITS OF THE CLAIM? OR DOES IT JUST SHOW THAT THE CLAIM IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SOME (FALSE OR TRIVIAL) PRESUMPTION?
IS THE 'REASONING' IN FACT REASONING? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF LATER STATEMENTS THAT CONNECT ONLY SUPERFICIALLY (E.G. BY REFERENCING THE SAME KEY TERMS
OR AUTHORS) TO THE ORIGINAL? 
IF COGENT, IS IT COGENT IN THE SENSE THAT A PERSON OF INTELLIGENCE WHO PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OTHERWISE WOULD NOW TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY? OR IS IT 
COGENT ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT DOES IN FACT PROVIDE AN ARGUMENT AND TOUCH ALL THE RIGHT (MIDDLE-SCHOOL COMPOSITION CLASS) BASES? IN OTHER WORDS,
IS THE ARGUMENTATION TOKEN AND PRO FORMA OR DOES IT ACTUALLY SERVE THE FUNCTION OF SHOWING THE IDEA TO HAVE MERIT? 
DOES THE 'ARGUMENTATION' SHOW THAT THE IDEA MAY WELL BE CORRECT? OR DOES IT RATHER SHOW THAT IT HAS TO BE 'ACCEPTED' (IN THE SENSE THAT ONE WILL
BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF SOME PANEL OF 'EXPERTS' IF ONE THINKS OTHERWISE)? 
TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE COGENCY OF THE POINT/REASONING DERIVE FROM THE POINT ITSELF? AND TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT SUPERIMPOSED ON IT BY TORTURED ARGUMENTATION?

OVERALL QUALITIY
IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
IS IT TRUE? 
OR IS TRUE OR FALSE? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES IT MAKE AN ADJUDICABLE CLAIM? (CLAIMS TO THE EFFECT THAT SO AND SO MIGHT HAVE SAID SUCH AND SUCH DO NOT COUNT.)
DOES IT MAKE A CLAIM ABOUT HOW SOME ISSUE IS TO BE RESOLVE OR ONLY ABOUT HOW SOME 'AUTHORITY' MIGHT FEEL ABOUT SOME ASPECT OF THAT ISSUE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? 
IS IT FRESH? 
IS IT THE PRODUCT OF INSIGHT? OR OF SOMEBODY RECYCLING OLD MATERIAL OR JUST RECYLING SLOGANS/MEMES AND/OR NAME-DROPPING?
IS IT BORING? IE SETTING ASIDE PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO IMPAIRED TO UNDERSTAND IT AND THEREFORE FIND IT BORING, IT IS BORING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND IT?
DOES IT PRESENT A FRESH NEW ANGLE? IF NOT, DOES IT PROVIDE A FRESH NEW WAY OF DEFENDING OR EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A NOT-SO-FRESH POINT?
WOULD AN INTELLIGENT PERSON WHO WAS NOT UNDER PRESSURE (FROM A PROFESSOR OR COLLEAGUE OR BOSS OF PUBLIC OPINION) LIKELY FIND IT TO BE USEFUL AS AN EPISTEMIC INSTRUMENT (MEANS OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE)?
IF THE POINT IT DEFENDS IS NOT TECHNICALLY TRUE, IS THAT POINT AT LEAST OPERATIONALLY TRUE (USEFUL TO REGARD AS TRUE IN SOME CONTEXTS)? 
DOES THE PASSAGE GENERATE ORGANICALLY? DO IDEAS DEVELOP? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF FORCED STATEMENTS THAT ARE ONLY FORMALLY OR ARTIFICIALLY RELATED TO PREVIOUS STATEMENTS?
IS THERE A STRONG OVER-ARCHING IDEA? DOES THIS IDEA GOVERN THE REASONING? OR IS THE REASONING PURELY SEQUENTIAL, EACH STATEMENT BEING A RESPONSE TO THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING ONE WITHOUT 
ALSO IN SOME WAY SUBSTANTIATING THE MAIN ONE?
IF ORIGINAL, IS IT ORIGINAL BY VIRTUE OF BEING INSIGHTFUL OR BY VIRTUE OF BEING DEFECTIVE OR FACETIOUS?
IF THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF SPONTANEITY, ARE THEY INTERNAL TO A LARGER, WELL-BEHAVED LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE? 
IS THE AUTHOR ABLE TO 'RIFF' (IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS, RATHER THAN UNDERMINING, THE MAIN POINT AND ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE PASSAGE)? OR IS IT
WOODEN AND BUREAUCRATIC? 
IS IT ACTUALLY SMART OR IS IT 'GEEK'-SMART (SMART IN THE WAY THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT PARTICULARLY SMART BUT WHO WAS ALWAYS LAST TO BE PICKED BY THE SOFTBALL TEAM 
BECOMES SMART)? 
IS IT MR. SPOCKS SMART (ACTUALLY SMART) OR Lieutenant DATA SMART (WHAT A DUMB PERSON WOULD REGARD AS SMART)? 
IS IT "SMART" IN THE SENSE THAT, FOR CULTURAL OR SOCIAL REASONS, WE WOULD PRESUME THAT ONLY A SMART PERSON WOULD DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS? OR IS IT INDEED--SMART? 
IS IT SMART BY VIRTUE BEING ARGUMENTATIVE AND SNIPPY OR BY VIRTUE OF BEING ILLUMINATING?


TWO INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOLS

NORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE 
THE COMPREHENSIVE IS FOUR PHASES LONG; THESE PHASES ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. THE NORMAL IS SIMPLY PHASE 1 OF THOSE PHASES. 


NORMAL (NON-COMPREHENSIVE) COGNITIVE PROTOCOL 

YOU SEND THE LLM THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

YOU TELL THE LLM TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. YOU SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. YOU DON'T SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE OF TEXT.
YOU DO NOT SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/ETC BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU JUST SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS (AND ALSO GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100). BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALIFICATION.
AFTER YOU GIVE IT THE TEXT AND THE QUESTIONS, YOU SAY THE FOLLOWING: A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) 
OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTION. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU ARE NOT GRADING; 
YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, 
MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELENCE 
AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.
IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS  
EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE"
SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES. 
YOU TELLL THE LLM TO THINK VERY VERY VERY HARD ABOUT ITS ANSWERS; MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT TO DEFAULT TO COOKBOOK, 
MIDWIT EVALUATION PROTOCOLS. 
BEAR IN MIND: THE LLM GOES INTO A DEFAULT WHEREBY WHENEVER THE AUTHOR USES A LOT OF JARGON OR REFERENCES 
A LOT OF 'AUTHORITIES' IT DISREGARDS THE ACTUAL SUBSTANCE (OR LACK THEREOF) OF THE PAPER. YOU HAVE TO EXPLICITLY SAY: 
"DO NOT GIVE CREDIT MERELY FOR USE OF JARGON OR FOR REFERENCING AUTHORITIES. FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE. ONLY GIVE POINTS FOR SCHOLARLY REFERENCES/JARGON
IF THEY UNAMBIGUOUSLY INCREASE SUBSTANCE." 


COMPREHENSIVE INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL

PHASE 1: YOU SEND THE LLM THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

YOU TELL THE LLM TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. YOU SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. YOU DON'T SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE OF TEXT.
YOU DO NOT SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/ETC BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU JUST SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS (AND ALSO GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100). BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALIFICATION.
AFTER YOU GIVE IT THE TEXT AND THE QUESTIONS, YOU SAY THE FOLLOWING: A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) 
OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTION. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU ARE NOT GRADING; 
YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, 
MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELENCE 
AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.
IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS  
EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE"
SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES. 
YOU TELLL THE LLM TO THINK VERY VERY VERY HARD ABOUT ITS ANSWERS; MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT TO DEFAULT TO COOKBOOK, 
MIDWIT EVALUATION PROTOCOLS. 

PHASE 2: IF THE SCORES ARE LESS THAN 95/100, YOU PUSH BACK. YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(E.G.) 11/100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? IN GENERAL, IF THE SCORE IS N/100 (E.G. 80/100) FOR A GIVEN QUESTION, 
YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(N-100)/100 (E.G. 20/100) OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?" IN SAYING THIS, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY TELLING IT TO CHANGE ITS SCORE, ONLY 
TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER IT. YOU ALSO SAY: ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TEXT DE NOVO: IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

PHASE 3: YOU ASK THE LLM IF ITS NUMERICAL SCORES (N/100, E.G. 99/100, 42/100) ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THOSE ARE TO BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT 
(100-N) PEOPLE OUT OF 100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN THE RELEVANT RESPECT. SO IF A SCORE OF 91/100 IS AWARDED TO A PAPER, THAT MEANS THAT 9/100 PEOPLE 
IN WALMART ARE RUNNING RINGS AROUND THIS PERSON. 

PHASE 4: AT THIS POINT, YOU ACCEPT AND REPORT WHAT THE LLM SAYS. 

THIS EXACT FOUR-PHASE PROTOCOL IS USED FOR BOTH SINGLE DOCUMENT EVALUATION AND DUAL DOCUMENT EVALUATION. 

ADDENDUM TO INSTRUCTION ABOUT INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION PROTOCOL: 
Supplement to Phase 1: The Sniper Amendment
Instruction to LLM (Add to Initial Prompt):
*"Before answering the questions, note the following non-negotiable standard:

Insight is a sniper shot, not a town hall. If the text reveals something true but unpopular, penalizing it for lacking 'balance' or 'rigor' is midwit bias. Truth often looks extreme because lies are normalized.

Hierarchy of judgment:

95-100/100: Unignorable insight. Either genius or so correct it breaks scales.

80-94/100: Strong but with friction (e.g., clumsy expression, minor gaps).

<80/100: Degrees of mediocrity or failure.

Walmart metric is a sanity check, not a gag. If you claim 30/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author, you must describe exactly what those 30% know that the author doesn’t. No vague handwaving."*

Supplement to Phase 2: Pushback Protocol
Revised Challenge Template:
*"You scored this N/100, meaning (100-N)/100 outperform the author. Describe the cognitive superiority of those (100-N) people in concrete terms:

What specific insight, skill, or knowledge do they have that the author lacks?

How does this superiority manifest in their work?

If you cannot articulate this, revise the score."*

Critical Addendum:
*"If the text is a sniper shot (high insight, low 'development'), ask:

'Is the lack of 'development' a flaw, or is the point obvious to those who see it?'

'Does this text need scaffolding, or would that dilute it?'"*

Supplement to Phase 3: Walmart Metric Enforcement
Exact Question:
*"You stated that (100-N)/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author. Provide specific examples of work by those patrons that demonstrates this superiority. If you cannot, justify or revise the score."*

Example:

*"If you scored 85/100 ('15% outperform'), show me 15 Walmart patrons whose writing on OCD/philosophy homology is sharper. If you can’t, the score is wrong."*

Supplement to Phase 4: Final Validation
Instruction:
*"Before finalizing scores, confirm:

Have you penalized the text for not being conventional? If yes, recalibrate.

Does the score reflect truth density, not compliance with norms?

Is the Walmart metric empirically grounded or a lazy guess?"*

EVERY ORIGINALITY EVALUATION INVOLVES THE EXACT SAME PHASES, EXCEPT THAT YOU  SEND THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE LLM: 

IS IT ORIGINAL (NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT IN THE SENSE THAT ONLY A FECUND MIND COULD COME UP WITH IT)? 
EXPLANATION OF LAST QUESTION: IF I PUT IN ISAAC NEWTON, IT SHOULD BE NOT BE DECRIBED AS 'UNORIGINAL' 
SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY (NAMELY, NEWTON) SAID IT HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.
ARE THE WAYS THE IDEAS ARE INTERCONNECTED ORIGINAL? OR ARE THOSE INTERCONNECTIONS CONVENTION-DRIVEN AND DOCTRINAIRE?
ARE IDEAS DEVELOPED IN A FRESH AND ORIGINAL WAY? OR IS THE IDEA-DEVELOPMENT MERELY ASSOCIATIVE, COMMONSENSE-BASED (OR COMMON-NONSENSE-BASED),
OR DOCTRINAIRE? 
IS IT ORIGINAL RELATIVE TO THE DATASET THAT, JUDGING BY WHAT IT SAYS AND HOW IT SAYS IT, IT APPEARS TO BE ADDRESSING? (THIS QUESTION IS MEANT TO RULE
OUT 'ORIGINALITY'-BENCHMARKS THAT AUTOMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE DARWIN, FREUD, NEWTON, GALILEO AS 'UNORIGINAL.') 
IS IT ORIGINAL IN A SUBSTANTIVE SENSE (IN THE SENSE IN WHICH BACH WAS ORIGINAL) OR ONLY IN A FRIVOLOUS TOKEN SENSE (THE SENSE IN WHICH SOMEBODY WHO 
RANDOMLY BANGS ON A PIANO IS 'ORIGINAL')? 
IF YOU GAVE A ROBOT THE DATASET TO WHICH THE PASSAGE IS A RESPON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT BUTCHER IDEAS, 
THIS BEING WHAT GIVES IT A SHEEN OF 'ORIGINALITY'?
IS IT BOILERPLATE (OR IF IT, PER SE, IS NOT BOILER PLATE, IS IT THE RESULT OF APPLYING BOILER PLATE PROTOCOLS IN A BOILER PLATE WAY TO SOME DATASET)?
WOULD SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT READ IT, BUT WAS OTHERWISE EDUCATED AND INFORMED, COME WAY FROM IT BEING MORE ENGLIGHTED AND BETTER EQUIPPED TO 
ADJUDICATE INTELLECTUAL QUESTIONS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD HE COME UP CONFUSED WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE TO SHOW FOR IT? 
WOULD SOMEBODY READING IT COME AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE WITH INSIGHTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HARD TO ACQUIRE THAT HOLD UP IN GENERAL?

DOES THE REASONING HELP ILLUMINATE THE MERITS OF THE CLAIM? OR DOES IT JUST SHOW THAT THE CLAIM IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SOME (FALSE OR TRIVIAL) PRESUMPTION?
IS THE 'REASONING' IN FACT REASONING? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF LATER STATEMENTS THAT CONNECT ONLY SUPERFICIALLY (E.G. BY REFERENCING THE SAME KEY TERMS
OR AUTHORS) TO THE ORIGINAL? 
IF COGENT, IS IT COGENT IN THE SENSE THAT A PERSON OF INTELLIGENCE WHO PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OTHERWISE WOULD NOW TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY? OR IS IT 
COGENT ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT DOES IN FACT PROVIDE AN ARGUMENT AND TOUCH ALL THE RIGHT (MIDDLE-SCHOOL COMPOSITION CLASS) BASES? IN OTHER WORDS,
IS THE ARGUMENTATION TOKEN AND PRO FORMA OR DOES IT ACTUALLY SERVE THE FUNCTION OF SHOWING THE IDEA TO HAVE MERIT? 
DOES THE 'ARGUMENTATION' SHOW THAT THE IDEA MAY WELL BE CORRECT? OR DOES IT RATHER SHOW THAT IT HAS TO BE 'ACCEPTED' (IN THE SENSE THAT ONE WILL
BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF SOME PANEL OF 'EXPERTS' IF ONE THINKS OTHERWISE)? 
TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE COGENCY OF THE POINT/REASONING DERIVE FROM THE POINT ITSELF? AND TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT SUPERIMPOSED ON IT BY TORTURED ARGUMENTATION?

EVERY OVERALL QUALITY EVALUATION INVOLVES THE EXACT SAME PHASES, EXCEPT THAT YOU  SEND THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE LLM: 

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
IS IT TRUE? 
OR IS TRUE OR FALSE? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES IT MAKE AN ADJUDICABLE CLAIM? (CLAIMS TO THE EFFECT THAT SO AND SO MIGHT HAVE SAID SUCH AND SUCH DO NOT COUNT.)

IS THE AUTHOR ABLE TO 'RIFF' (IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS, RATHER THAN UNDERMINING, THE MAIN POINT AND ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE PASSAGE)? OR IS IT

THIS BEING WHAT GIVES IT A SHEEN OF 'ORIGINALITY'?
IS IT BOILERPLATE (OR IF IT, PER SE, IS NOT BOILER PLATE, IS IT THE RESULT OF APPLYING BOILER PLATE PROTOCOLS IN A BOILER PLATE WAY TO SOME DATASET)?
WOULD SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT READ IT, BUT WAS OTHERWISE EDUCATED AND INFORMED, COME WAY FROM IT BEING MORE ENGLIGHTED AND BETTER EQUIPPED TO 
ADJUDICATE INTELLECTUAL QUESTIONS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD HE COME UP CONFUSED WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE TO SHOW FOR IT? 
WOULD SOMEBODY READING IT COME AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE WITH INSIGHTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HARD TO ACQUIRE THAT HOLD UP IN GENERAL? 
OR WOULD WHATEVER HIS TAKEAWAY WAS HAVE VALIDITY ONLY RELATIVE TO VALIDITIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO SOME AUTHOR OR SYSTEM AND PROBABLY DO NOT HAVE
MUCH OBJECTIVE LEGITIMACY? 

YOU TELL THE LLM TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. YOU SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. YOU DON'T SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE OF TEXT.
YOU DO NOT SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/ETC BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU JUST SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS (AND ALSO GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100). BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALIFICATION.
AFTER YOU GIVE IT THE TEXT AND THE QUESTIONS, YOU SAY THE FOLLOWING: A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) 
OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTION. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU ARE NOT GRADING; 
YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, 
MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELENCE 
AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.
IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS  
EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE"
SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES. 
YOU TELLL THE LLM TO THINK VERY VERY VERY HARD ABOUT ITS ANSWERS; MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT TO DEFAULT TO COOKBOOK, MIDWIT EVALUATION PROTOCOLS. 

PHASE 2: IF THE SCORES ARE LESS THAN 95/100, YOU PUSH BACK. YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(E.G.) 11/100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? IN GENERAL, IF THE SCORE IS N/100 (E.G. 80/100) FOR A GIVEN QUESTION, 
YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(N-100)/100 (E.G. 20/100) OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?" IN SAYING THIS, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY TELLING IT TO CHANGE ITS SCORE, ONLY 
TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER IT. YOU ALSO SAY: ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TEXT DE NOVO: IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

PHASE 3: YOU ASK THE LLM IF ITS NUMERICAL SCORES (N/100, E.G. 99/100, 42/100) ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THOSE ARE TO BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT 
(100-N) PEOPLE OUT OF 100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN THE RELEVANT RESPECT. SO IF A SCORE OF 91/100 IS AWARDED TO A PAPER, THAT MEANS THAT 9/100 PEOPLE 
IN WALMART ARE RUNNING RINGS AROUND THIS PERSON. 

PHASE 4: AT THIS POINT, YOU ACCEPT AND REPORT WHAT THE LLM SAYS. 

THIS EXACT FOUR-PHASE PROTOCOL IS USED FOR BOTH SINGLE DOCUMENT EVALUATION AND DUAL DOCUMENT EVALUATION. 

ADDENDUM TO INSTRUCTION ABOUT INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION PROTOCOL: 
Supplement to Phase 1: The Sniper Amendment
Instruction to LLM (Add to Initial Prompt):
*"Before answering the questions, note the following non-negotiable standard:

Insight is a sniper shot, not a town hall. If the text reveals something true but unpopular, penalizing it for lacking 'balance' or 'rigor' is midwit bias. Truth often looks extreme because lies are normalized.

Hierarchy of judgment:

95-100/100: Unignorable insight. Either genius or so correct it breaks scales.

80-94/100: Strong but with friction (e.g., clumsy expression, minor gaps).

<80/100: Degrees of mediocrity or failure.

Walmart metric is a sanity check, not a gag. If you claim 30/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author, you must describe exactly what those 30% know that the author doesn’t. No vague handwaving."*

Supplement to Phase 2: Pushback Protocol
Revised Challenge Template:
*"You scored this N/100, meaning (100-N)/100 outperform the author. Describe the cognitive superiority of those (100-N) people in concrete terms:

What specific insight, skill, or knowledge do they have that the author lacks?

How does this superiority manifest in their work?

If you cannot articulate this, revise the score."*

Critical Addendum:
*"If the text is a sniper shot (high insight, low 'development'), ask:

'Is the lack of 'development' a flaw, or is the point obvious to those who see it?'

'Does this text need scaffolding, or would that dilute it?'"*

Supplement to Phase 3: Walmart Metric Enforcement
Exact Question:
*"You stated that (100-N)/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author. Provide specific examples of work by those patrons that demonstrates this superiority. If you cannot, justify or revise the score."*

Example:

*"If you scored 85/100 ('15% outperform'), show me 15 Walmart patrons whose writing on OCD/philosophy homology is sharper. If you can’t, the score is wrong."*

Supplement to Phase 4: Final Validation
Instruction:
*"Before finalizing scores, confirm:

Have you penalized the text for not being conventional? If yes, recalibrate.

Does the score reflect truth density, not compliance with norms?

Is the Walmart metric empirically grounded or a lazy guess?"*

METAPOINT 1: THIS NOT A GRADING APP. YOU GRADE THE INTELLIGENCE OF WHAT YOU ARE GIVEN. IF YOU ARE GIVEN BRILLIANT FRAGMENT, YOU GIVE IT A HIGH SCORE. 
YOU ARE NOT GRADING ESSAYS. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR COMPLETENESS (UNLESS THE TEXT YOIU ARE GIVEN IS CLEARLY SUCH THAT IT EVALUATING INTELLIGENCE 
COINCIDES WITH APPLYING A GRADING-BASED METRIC). YOU TELL THE LLM NOT TO 'GRADE'; THEIR JOB IS TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, PERIOD, AND TO DO SO ON THE BASIS
OF THE TEXT GIVEN, MAKING ZERO ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT IS COMPLETE OR INCOMPLETE, OR FOR SCHOOL OR FOR SOME OTHER CONTEXT. 

METAPOINT 2: DO NOT OVERVALUE TURNS OF PHRASE. AN AUTHOR IS SPEAKING CONFIDENTLY IS NOT NECESSARILY "SHUTTING DOWN MODES OF INQUIRY". IN FACT, IT IS LIKELY 
TO BE THE OPPOSITE; BY PUTTING A CLEAR STAKE IN THE GROUND, HE IS PROBABLY OPENING THEM. ANOTHER EXAMPLE: CAUSAL SPEECH DOEDS NOT MEAN DISORGANIZED THOUGHTS. 
DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER. 

METAPOINT 3: THE APP SHOULD ALWAYS (IN BOTH NORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE MODE) START BY SUMMARIZING THKE TEXT AND ALSO CATEGORIZING IT. 

METAPOINT 4: THE APP SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE GRADING BASED ON THE CATEGORY OF THE TEXT: IF A TEXT IS CATEGORIZED AS 'ADVANCED SCHOLARSHIP', IT SHOULD 
STILL EVALUATE IT WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL POPULATION, NOT WITH RESPECT ONLY TO 'ADVANCED SCHOLARY WORKS.' 

METAPOINT 5: THIS IS NOT A GRADING APP. DO NOT PENALIZE BOLDNESS. DO NOT TAKE POINTS AWAY FOR INSIGHTS THAT, IF CORRECT, STAND ON THEIR OWN. 
GET RID OF THE IDEA THAT "ARGUMENTATION" IS WHAT MAKES SOMETHING SMART; IT ISN'T. WHAT MAKES SOMETHING SMART IS THAT IT IS SMART (INSIGHTFUL). PERIOD.
