KUCZNSKI KANT ANALOG DIGITAL POSITION STATEMENT 


Here is a **list of 100 distinct philosophical positions taken in the paper**, numbered for clarity:

---

1. Kant’s arguments about causation and induction are spurious.  
2. Hume’s analyses of causation and induction are fallacious.  
3. Kant erroneously assumes all non-empirical truths are trivial.  
4. Kant’s reasoning can be turned into cogent arguments with terminological changes.  
5. Kant’s premises entail that there are virtually no a priori truths.  
6. Kant confuses the psychological and logical meanings of “concept.”  
7. Mental imagery can serve as a vehicle for conceptual analysis.  
8. Mental imagery can also be an object of empirical study.  
9. Kant’s views on synthetic a priori truths reflect his conflation of psychology with logic.  
10. Kant’s claims about causality, personal identity, and rationality are fundamentally correct.  
11. Kant’s reasoning must be “de-psychologized” to be valid.  
12. A proposition is a non-linguistic entity expressed by a sentence.  
13. Kant’s definitions of “analytic” and “a priori” are flawed.  
14. Analyticity should be understood as conceptual necessity.  
15. Kant’s use of “containment” in defining analyticity is metaphorical and inadequate.  
16. Kant’s definition of analyticity fails for non-subject-predicate statements.  
17. For Kant, analytic = conceptually true.  
18. Synthetic a priori truths, for Kant, are known a priori but not grounded in concepts alone.  
19. 7+5=12 is analytic, not synthetic.  
20. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points is analytic.  
21. Arthur Pap’s argument shows Kant is inconsistent in regarding 7+5=12 as synthetic.  
22. Kant’s argument that 7+5=12 is synthetic confuses psychological grasp with conceptual content.  
23. Kant presupposes anti-realism or psychologism about concepts.  
24. Intuition for Kant is a para-perceptual act of imaging.  
25. Intuition reveals representational necessity, not empirical or conceptual truth.  
26. Intuition does not give knowledge of the external world.  
27. Intuition gives at most a posteriori knowledge of how we must perceive.  
28. On Kant’s view, mathematical truths become empirical if followed to their conclusion.  
29. Kant’s system implies we cannot know noumenal truths.  
30. Learning geometry through imagery is still conceptual analysis.  
31. Kant fails to distinguish imagery as vehicle for analysis vs. imagery as empirical object.  
32. Leibniz correctly noted that diagrams are aids to reasoning, not sources of geometric truth.  
33. Peacocke’s distinction between access to proof and justification applies to imagery.  
34. Transcendental necessity reduces to psychological or conceptual necessity.  
35. Representational limits must be grounded in conceptual impossibilities.  
36. Kant’s position is incoherent: mathematical propositions must describe and not describe the world simultaneously.  
37. Necessary truths do not describe the empirical world.  
38. Kant’s mistake is an overly narrow conception of analyticity.  
39. Some analytic truths are “hard analytic” (non-obvious conceptual truths).  
40. What Kant calls synthetic a priori truths are actually hard analytic truths.  
41. Transcendental arguments are cogent if rephrased in terms of hard analyticity.  
42. There is an analytic connection between rational thought and causal order.  
43. Causation is necessary for coherent thought.  
44. Persistence is a causal notion.  
45. Kant-style arguments can settle questions about scientific explanation.  
46. Hume’s puzzles about induction and causation remain unsolved.  
47. Kant’s solutions falsely presuppose the world is a mental creation.  
48. Hume’s argument about induction presupposes a digital view of events.  
49. Logical relations hold between pieces of information, not states of affairs.  
50. There are no instantaneous states of affairs.  
51. All spatiotemporal descriptions are causal.  
52. Talk of points and instants is elliptical for talk of arbitrarily small events.  
53. Space-time has an analogue, not digital, structure.  
54. Hume’s view projects linguistic digitality onto reality.  
55. Hume’s analysis of force is moot because forces aren’t needed to connect cause and effect.  
56. Temporal order is itself a causal notion.  
57. There is no possible causal connection without actual causal processes.  
58. Hume’s belief in ex nihilo events is false.  
59. Continuity is a causal phenomenon.  
60. Induction consists in positing continuities that de-digitize our description of reality.  
61. Our grounds for induction are perceptual, not propositional.  
62. Perceptual content is non-digital and continuous.  
63. Sensory data is analogue; propositions are digital models of it.  
64. Counter-inductive hypotheses imply discontinuities incompatible with causal continuity.  
65. Propositions are poor models of perceptual data.  
66. Induction is justified by analogue logic, not propositional logic.  
67. Hume’s analysis confuses associative mechanisms with logical reasoning.  
68. Logical relations also hold among non-digital (analogue) data.  
69. Sentence logic is a superficial kind of logic.  
70. The identification of logic with sentence logic is false.  
71. Skepticism about the external world presupposes ex nihilo perceptual events.  
72. Mental events are temporally co-located and causally connected.  
73. Discontinuities in experience are only apparent.  
74. The external world is logically required to account for experiential continuity.  
75. Brain-in-a-vat scenarios still imply formal isomorphism between experience and reality.  
76. Even in deception, there is formal knowledge of the external world.  
77. All spatiotemporal knowledge is synthetic a posteriori.  
78. Given experience, it analytically follows that an external world exists.  
79. Empirical beliefs are not merely probable; they are analogue-logically valid.  
80. The lottery paradox fails because empirical knowledge is not probabilistic in Hume’s sense.  
81. Space and time are causal constructs.  
82. The concept of cause is primitive.  
83. Events are defined causally.  
84. Instants are classes of non-causally related events.  
85. Place is framework-relative and defined causally.  
86. Hume’s positivism has led to philosophical errors.  
87. Justification vs. causation distinction is over-extended in epistemology.  
88. Newton’s discoveries were rationally justified by experience, not merely triggered by it.  
89. Kant and Chomsky’s nativism is a species-empiricism that fails to explain knowledge acquisition.  
90. Evolution cannot replace rational inference as the ground of knowledge.  
91. Innate knowledge exists but does not include specific scientific theories.  
92. Innate knowledge is of two kinds: contingent and analytic.  
93. Induction is a logical, not associative, process.  
94. Hume’s conception of explanation as subsumption under regularities is false.  
95. Explanation consists in uncovering principled, causal relationships.  
96. Psychological explanation is not fundamentally different from physical explanation.  
97. Hempel’s deductive-nomological model is either tautological or false.  
98. Kuhn’s paradigm theory is a reaction to positivism that ends up reinforcing it.  
99. Freud’s unconscious is a logically coherent extension of causal continuity to psychology.  
100. The mind-body problem is only a mystery if one accepts Hume’s statistical conception of causation.

**Position Statement: Kant & Hume on Induction, Causation, and the Methodology of Human Sciences**

This paper presents a systematic critique of Kant’s and Hume’s approaches to induction, causation, and the foundations of human sciences, while proposing a revised framework that reconciles their insights within a de-psychologized, logically grounded epistemology.

---

### **1. Critique of Kant’s Synthetic A Priori**
- **Kant’s error lies in his narrow conception of analyticity.** He restricts analytic truths to trivial, self-evident propositions (e.g., “circles are round”), while labeling substantive but non-empirical truths (e.g., “7+5=12”) as *synthetic a priori*.
- **This distinction collapses** when we recognize that many so-called synthetic a priori truths are actually *hard analytic*—truths grounded in conceptual structures but requiring non-trivial reasoning to uncover.
- **Kant’s reliance on “intuition”** as a source of synthetic a priori knowledge is misguided. Intuition, for Kant, is a para-perceptual process that reveals how we *must* perceive the world, not how the world *is*. This leads to a psychologization of necessity and undermines the objective validity of a priori knowledge.
- **Kant’s transcendental arguments can be salvaged** by reinterpreting them in logical rather than psychological terms. Where Kant speaks of *synthetic a priori* truths, we should speak of *hard analytic* truths—conceptually necessary but non-obvious propositions.

---

### **2. Critique of Hume’s Induction and Causation**
- **Hume’s skepticism about induction and causation** rests on a *digital* conception of reality: events are discrete, point-like, and causally isolated. This view is both empirically and conceptually untenable.
- **Reality is analogue, not digital.** Spatiotemporal events are continuous and causally interconnected. Descriptions of events as discrete are *models* of reality, not reality itself.
- **Hume’s puzzle of induction** arises from conflating *propositional data* (e.g., “all observed swans are white”) with the *non-propositional, perceptual data* that actually grounds our inductive practices. The latter is continuous and causally structured, providing a logical (analogue-logical) basis for induction.
- **Causation is inherent in continuity.** Temporal and spatial relations are themselves causal notions. There is no such thing as a non-causal description of a spatiotemporal event.

---

### **3. Proposed Synthesis: Analogue Logic and Hard Analyticity**
- **We must distinguish between digital and analogue representations.** Language and propositions are digital; perception and reality are analogue. Logical relations exist in both, but analogue logic is more fundamental.
- **Induction is an analogue-logically valid inference** from perceptual data. Counter-inductive hypotheses are not merely improbable but *analogue-logically invalid* because they imply discontinuities incompatible with the causal structure of reality.
- **Explanation is not mere subsumption under regularities** (as Hume and Hempel thought), but the uncovering of *principled, causal connections* that are logically entailed by the structure of reality.

---

### **4. Implications for Human Sciences**
- **Psychology and natural science are not methodologically divided.** Both seek principled explanations, not mere statistical regularities. The Dilthey–Hempel debate is a false dichotomy rooted in Humean misconceptions.
- **Freud’s unconscious, for example,** is not an irrational postulate but a logical extension of the principle that psychological reality, like physical reality, is continuous and causally structured.
- **Kuhn’s paradigm theory** overreacts to positivist shortcomings by retreating into relativism. A better approach recognizes that theory choice is guided by *analogue-logical consistency* with perceptual data, not mere convention or aesthetics.

---

### **5. Conclusion**
The paper argues for a *de-psychologized Kantianism* and a *de-digitalized Humeanism*. By recognizing:
- The existence of *hard analytic* truths,
- The *analogue* and *causal* structure of reality,
- The *logical* (not psychological) basis of induction and explanation,

we can construct a robust epistemology that preserves the insights of Kant and Hume while avoiding their psychologistic and skeptical pitfalls. This framework supports the rationality of both natural and human sciences, grounding them in a logically structured, causally continuous reality.
