## Calculation Requirements

The function must perform the following calculations with formulas (not hard-coded values):

**Income Statement Calculations:**

Revenue:
1. Revenue = Prior Year Revenue × (1 + Growth Rate), or
2. Revenue = Σ(Segment Revenues) if segment detail provided

Cost of Goods Sold:
1. COGS = Revenue × (1 - Gross Margin %), or
2. COGS = Revenue × COGS % of Revenue

Gross Profit:
1. Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
2. Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Revenue

Operating Expenses:
1. SG&A = Revenue × SG&A % of Revenue, or
2. SG&A = Prior Year SG&A × (1 + Growth Rate)
3. R&D = Revenue × R&D % of Revenue (if applicable)
4. Other OpEx = Revenue × Other OpEx % (if applicable)
5. Total Operating Expenses = SG&A + R&D + Other OpEx

EBITDA:
1. EBITDA = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
2. EBITDA Margin % = EBITDA / Revenue

Depreciation & Amortization:
1. D&A = Revenue × D&A % of Revenue, or
2. D&A = Beginning PP&E × D&A Rate + (CapEx × Half-Year Convention)

EBIT (Operating Income):
1. EBIT = EBITDA - D&A
2. EBIT Margin % = EBIT / Revenue

Interest Expense:
1. Interest Expense = Average Debt Balance × Interest Rate
2. For multiple tranches: Σ(Tranche Balance × Tranche Rate)
3. Revolver Interest = Average Drawn Balance × Rate + Undrawn × Commitment Fee

Interest Income:
1. Interest Income = Average Cash Balance × Interest Rate on Cash

EBT (Earnings Before Tax):
1. EBT = EBIT - Interest Expense + Interest Income + Other Income/Expense

Income Tax:
1. If EBT > 0: Tax = EBT × Effective Tax Rate
2. If EBT < 0 and NOLs allowed: Tax = 0, increase NOL carryforward
3. If prior NOLs exist: Reduce taxable income, then apply tax rate

Net Income:
1. Net Income = EBT - Income Tax
2. Net Margin % = Net Income / Revenue

Earnings Per Share:
1. Basic EPS = Net Income / Weighted Average Shares Outstanding
2. Diluted EPS = Net Income / (Shares + Dilutive Securities)

**Balance Sheet Calculations:**

Assets:

Current Assets:
1. Cash = Solved via Cash Flow Statement (plug)
2. Accounts Receivable = Revenue × (DSO / 365), or Revenue × AR % of Revenue
3. Inventory = COGS × (DIO / 365), or COGS × Inventory % of COGS
4. Prepaid Expenses = Revenue × Prepaid % of Revenue
5. Other Current Assets = Revenue × Other CA % of Revenue
6. Total Current Assets = Cash + AR + Inventory + Prepaid + Other CA

Non-Current Assets:
1. PP&E, Beginning = Prior Year PP&E, Ending
2. Plus: Capital Expenditures
3. Less: Depreciation
4. PP&E, Ending = Beginning + CapEx - Depreciation
5. Intangible Assets = Prior Year - Amortization + Additions
6. Goodwill = Prior Year (no change unless impairment or acquisition)
7. Other Long-Term Assets = Prior Year + Changes
8. Total Non-Current Assets = PP&E + Intangibles + Goodwill + Other LT Assets

Total Assets = Total Current Assets + Total Non-Current Assets

Liabilities:

Current Liabilities:
1. Accounts Payable = COGS × (DPO / 365), or COGS × AP % of COGS
2. Accrued Expenses = Revenue × Accrued % of Revenue (or OpEx based)
3. Deferred Revenue = Revenue × Deferred % of Revenue (if applicable)
4. Current Portion of Long-Term Debt = Next 12 months mandatory payments
5. Other Current Liabilities = Revenue × Other CL % of Revenue
6. Total Current Liabilities = AP + Accrued + Deferred Rev + Current Debt + Other CL

Non-Current Liabilities:
1. Long-Term Debt = Prior Year Ending - Repayments + New Issuance
2. Deferred Tax Liability = Prior Year + Change (if modeled)
3. Other Long-Term Liabilities = Prior Year + Changes
4. Total Non-Current Liabilities = LT Debt + DTL + Other LT Liabilities

Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-Current Liabilities

Shareholders' Equity:
1. Common Stock = Prior Year + New Issuance (at par)
2. Additional Paid-In Capital = Prior Year + New Issuance (excess over par) + Stock-Based Comp
3. Retained Earnings = Prior Year + Net Income - Dividends
4. Treasury Stock = Prior Year - Buybacks (at cost)
5. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income = Prior Year + OCI (if modeled)
6. Total Shareholders' Equity = Common Stock + APIC + Retained Earnings - Treasury Stock + AOCI

Total Liabilities + Equity = Total Assets (MUST BALANCE)

**Cash Flow Statement Calculations:**

Operating Activities:
1. Net Income (from Income Statement)
2. Add: Depreciation & Amortization (non-cash)
3. Add: Stock-Based Compensation (non-cash)
4. Add/Less: Deferred Taxes (non-cash)
5. Less: Increase in Accounts Receivable (or Add: Decrease)
6. Less: Increase in Inventory (or Add: Decrease)
7. Less: Increase in Prepaid/Other CA (or Add: Decrease)
8. Add: Increase in Accounts Payable (or Less: Decrease)
9. Add: Increase in Accrued/Other CL (or Less: Decrease)
10. Cash Flow from Operating Activities = Sum of above

Investing Activities:
1. Less: Capital Expenditures (PP&E purchases)
2. Less: Acquisitions (if applicable)
3. Add: Asset Sales/Disposals (if applicable)
4. Less: Purchases of Investments (if applicable)
5. Add: Sales of Investments (if applicable)
6. Cash Flow from Investing Activities = Sum of above

Financing Activities:
1. Add: Proceeds from Debt Issuance
2. Less: Debt Repayments
3. Add: Proceeds from Equity Issuance
4. Less: Share Buybacks
5. Less: Dividends Paid
6. Cash Flow from Financing Activities = Sum of above

Net Change in Cash:
1. Net Change = CFO + CFI + CFF
2. Beginning Cash Balance
3. Ending Cash Balance = Beginning + Net Change

**Circular Reference Handling (Revolver/Cash):**

The 3-statement model contains a natural circularity:
- Interest Expense depends on Debt Balance
- Debt Balance may depend on Cash Shortfall
- Cash depends on Net Income
- Net Income depends on Interest Expense

Resolution approach:
1. Calculate preliminary cash balance before revolver/excess cash
2. If Cash < Minimum Cash: Draw on revolver to fund shortfall
3. If Cash > Target Cash: Use excess for debt paydown or accumulate
4. Iterate calculation (or use Excel's iterative calculation setting)
5. Alternative: Use average debt balance for interest calculation

**Key Financial Ratios and Metrics:**

Profitability Ratios:
1. Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Revenue
2. EBITDA Margin % = EBITDA / Revenue
3. EBIT Margin % = EBIT / Revenue
4. Net Margin % = Net Income / Revenue
5. Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity
6. Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Average Total Assets
7. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) = NOPAT / Invested Capital

Liquidity Ratios:
1. Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
2. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
3. Cash Ratio = Cash / Current Liabilities

Leverage Ratios:
1. Debt / Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
2. Debt / EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA
3. Net Debt / EBITDA = (Total Debt - Cash) / EBITDA
4. Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
5. Fixed Charge Coverage = (EBIT + Lease Payments) / (Interest + Lease Payments)

Efficiency Ratios:
1. Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets
2. Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
3. Receivables Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable
4. Payables Turnover = COGS / Average Accounts Payable
5. Cash Conversion Cycle = DSO + DIO - DPO

Per Share Metrics:
1. Basic EPS = Net Income / Weighted Average Shares
2. Diluted EPS = Net Income / Diluted Shares
3. Book Value per Share = Shareholders' Equity / Shares Outstanding
4. Dividends per Share = Total Dividends / Shares Outstanding

## Error Handling

The function must validate:
- Balance sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) in all periods
- Cash flow statement reconciles to change in cash balance
- No negative cash balance (unless revolver available)
- Interest coverage ratio > 0 (company can service debt)
- Revenue growth rates are reasonable (-50% to +200%)
- Margins are between -100% and +100%
- Working capital days are positive and reasonable (0-365 days)
- Tax rate is between 0% and 50%
- Shares outstanding are positive
- All required fields are present in natural language input

If validation fails, return error message specifying which constraint is violated.

Circular reference handling:

## Example Input

"Build me a three-statement integrated financial model for Precision Manufacturing Inc, an industrial equipment company. I'll give you historical data and then projection assumptions.

For historical context, fiscal year 2024 just ended with revenue of one point eight billion dollars. Cost of goods sold was one point one seven billion, giving us a gross margin of thirty-five percent. SG&A expenses were three hundred and sixty million, and R&D was fifty-four million. EBITDA came in at two hundred and sixteen million for a twelve percent EBITDA margin. Depreciation and amortization was ninety million. Interest expense was forty-five million on total debt of seven hundred and fifty million. Net income was fifty-four million after a twenty-five percent effective tax rate. We ended the year with ninety million in cash, twelve hundred million in total assets, and four hundred and fifty million in shareholders equity. There are fifty million shares outstanding.

For the projections, I want a five-year model with the following assumptions. Revenue should grow at eight percent in year one as we expand into new geographic markets. Year two should see ten percent growth from new product launches. Years three through five will moderate to six percent annual growth as the market matures.

Gross margin should improve from thirty-five percent to thirty-seven percent over the projection period as we realize manufacturing efficiencies from automation investments. Model this as a linear improvement.

SG&A should decline from twenty percent of revenue to eighteen percent of revenue by year five as we leverage our existing infrastructure. R&D will stay constant at three percent of revenue to maintain our innovation pipeline.

For working capital, use forty-five days sales outstanding for accounts receivable, sixty days inventory on hand, and forty days payable. Prepaid expenses run at one percent of revenue, and accrued liabilities are about fifteen percent of operating expenses.

Capital expenditures will be elevated in the near term at seven percent of revenue in years one and two for the automation project, then normalize to five percent of revenue in years three through five. Depreciation should run at approximately five percent of revenue.

On the debt side, we have seven hundred and fifty million in term debt at six percent interest with mandatory amortization of fifty million per year. We also have a one hundred and fifty million revolving credit facility available at LIBOR plus two fifty, call that seven percent all-in, with a half percent commitment fee on undrawn amounts. Assume we maintain a minimum cash balance of seventy-five million and use any excess cash to pay down the revolver first.

The tax rate should stay at twenty-five percent. Stock-based compensation will be about one percent of revenue annually. We plan to pay dividends of fifty cents per share each year. No share buybacks planned.

Please build the complete three-statement model with all supporting schedules, ratio analysis, and make sure the balance sheet balances in every period. Include charts showing the key trends."
