## WHAT'S MISSING

1. **Logistic Regression** - Specified but not in comparison
2. **GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning** - Specified but not implemented
3. **Attrition rate** - Asked for 18%, got ~30%

## WHAT WORKS WELL

- ✅ Correct target variable (Attrition)
- ✅ Correct sample size (1500)
- ✅ Correct random_state (123)
- ✅ Stratified 80/20 split
- ✅ SMOTE applied
- ✅ 5-fold cross-validation
- ✅ All 5 metrics reported
- ✅ Confusion matrix
- ✅ ROC curve with AUC
- ✅ Feature importance (Top 15)
- ✅ Prediction function
- ✅ Model persistence (joblib)
- ✅ Visualizations saved

## SUMMARY

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Data generation | 90% |
| Model selection | 75% (missing LogReg) |
| Evaluation metrics | 100% |
| Visualizations | 100% |
| Hyperparameter tuning | 0% (missing GridSearchCV) |
| Output artifacts | 100% |

**Overall: 85%** — Solid output, but missed Logistic Regression and GridSearchCV tuning.
