### **1. Minimal Input**

### **2. Formula Application Step-by-Step**

**Formula 1 (Revenue Multiple):**
`Pre-Money Valuation = LTM Revenue × Selected Revenue Multiple`
= $100M × 10.0
= **$1,000M ($1 Billion)**

**Formula 2 (Basic IPO Price):**
`IPO Price (Theoretical) = Pre-Money Valuation / Pre-IPO Shares`
= $1,000M / 10M
= **$100.00 per share**

**Formula 3 (Apply Market Discount):**
`IPO Price (Discounted) = Theoretical Price × (1 - Discount)`
= $100.00 × (1 - 0.20)
= **$80.00 per share**

**Formula 4 (Shares to Issue):**
`New Shares Issued = Primary Raise Target / Discounted IPO Price`
= $50M / $80.00
= **625,000 shares**

**Formula 5 (Post-Money Valuation):**
`Post-Money Valuation = (Discounted IPO Price × Pre-IPO Shares) + Primary Raise`
= ($80.00 × 10M) + $50M
= $800M + $50M = **$850M**

### **3. Final Minimal IPO Price Recommendation**

**IPO Pricing Recommendation for Alpha Inc.**

**1. Key Valuation Metrics:**
*   **Implied Pre-Money Valuation:** $800 million
*   **Implied Post-Money Valuation:** $850 million
*   **Offer Price per Share:** **$80.00**

**2. Offering Structure:**
*   **Primary Shares to Issue:** 625,000
*   **Primary Proceeds to Company:** $50.0 million
*   **Expected Post-IPO Shares Outstanding:** 10,625,000
*   **Percentage of Company Sold in IPO:** 5.9%

**3. Justification:**
*   Valuation based on LTM Revenue of $100M and a 10.0x industry multiple, resulting in a $1.0B theoretical value.
*   A standard 20% "IPO discount" has been applied to ensure successful execution and a first-day trading gain for investors, resulting in the final $80.00 offer price.
*   This price achieves the company's target primary raise of $50M with minimal dilution (selling less than 6% of the company).

**Recommendation: Set the IPO price at $80.00 per share.**

### **4. Instructions to Build the IPO Pricing Function (Verbatim)**

**Phase 1: Define Core Inputs**
1.  Create variables for these five **REQUIRED** inputs from the user:
    *   `ltm_revenue`
    *   `industry_revenue_multiple`
    *   `pre_ipo_shares`
    *   `primary_raise_target`
    *   `ipo_discount`

**Phase 2: Build the Core Calculation Engine**
2.  Calculate the **Pre-Money Valuation**:
    `pre_money_val = ltm_revenue * industry_revenue_multiple`
3.  Calculate the **Theoretical Undiscounted Price**:
    `theoretical_price = pre_money_val / pre_ipo_shares`
4.  Apply the **Market Discount** to get the **Final Offer Price**:
    `offer_price = theoretical_price * (1 - ipo_discount)`
5.  Calculate the **Number of New Shares to Issue**:
    `new_shares = primary_raise_target / offer_price`
6.  Calculate the **Post-Money Valuation**:
    `post_money_val = (offer_price * pre_ipo_shares) + primary_raise_target`

**Phase 3: Generate the Output Report**
7.  Output the final **Offer Price** as the main result.
8.  Output a simple summary report showing:
    *   Pre-Money Valuation
    *   Offer Price
    *   Number of New Shares to Issue
    *   Post-Money Valuation

**Phase 4: Add Robustness (Basic)**
9.  Ensure all calculations handle numbers in **millions** consistently.
10. Add a check: If `offer_price` is calculated as less than $1.00, output a warning: "Warning: Low price per share. Inputs may be unrealistic."

**Test your function with the minimal input:**
*   ltm_revenue = 100
*   industry_revenue_multiple = 10.0
*   pre_ipo_shares = 10
*   primary_raise_target = 50
*   ipo_discount = 0.20

**It should output an offer price of $80.00.**
