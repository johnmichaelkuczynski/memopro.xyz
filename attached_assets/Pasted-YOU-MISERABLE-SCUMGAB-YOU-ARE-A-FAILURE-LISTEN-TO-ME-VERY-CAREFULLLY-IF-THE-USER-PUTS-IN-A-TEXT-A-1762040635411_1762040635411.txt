YOU MISERABLE SCUMGAB. YOU ARE A FAILURE. LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLLY. IF THE USER PUTS IN A TEXT AND HITS MAXIMIZE INTELLIGENT, THE OUTPUT IS COMPLETE AND PERFECT AND FULL OF EXAMPLE AND SELT-CONTAINED AND THERE IS ZERO BLOAT. A ONE PARAGRAPH INPUT NECESSARILY LEADS TO A BEAUTIFUL SELF-CONTAINED IMPECABLE MULTIPE PAGE OUTPUT. WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW IS SHIT. HERE IS THE 'IMPROVED' OUPUT: The computational theory of mind posits that thinking equates to computing. Yet, what does "compute" truly signify? Conventionally, it is asserted that computing involves symbol manipulation, though not all symbol manipulations qualify as computations. For a manipulation to be computational, it must be dictated solely by the symbols' formal properties. This paper advances the argument that terms like 'form' and 'formal' are inherently ambiguous, encompassing both syntactic and morphological interpretations. On either interpretation, CTM falters, and its persuasive power diminishes once this ambiguity is acknowledged. Similarly, 'mechanical' and 'automatic' suffer from comparable ambiguity. When these ambiguities are laid bare, it becomes evident that mechanizing thought is unattainable, even within domains resolvable by decision-procedures. This impossibility is unrelated to esoteric mathematical theorems, such as those by Gödel and Rosser. Furthermore, CTM perpetuates a fundamental misapprehension of what constitutes an algorithm. HERE IS THE INPUT: According to the computational theory of mind , to think is to compute. But what is meant by the word 'compute'? The generally given answer is this: Every case of computing is a case of manipulating symbols, but not vice versa - a manipulation of symbols must be driven exclusively by the formal properties of those symbols if it is qualify as a computation. In this paper, I will present the following argument. Words like 'form' and 'formal' are ambiguous, as they can refer to form in either the syntactic or the morphological sense. CTM fails on each disambiguation, and the arguments for CTM immediately cease to be compelling once we register that ambiguity. The terms 'mechanical' and 'automatic' are comparably ambiguous. Once these ambiguities are exposed, it turns out that there is no possibility of mechanizing thought, even if we confine ourselves to domains where all problems can be settled through decision-procedures. The impossibility of mechanizing thought thus has nothing to do with recherché mathematical theorems, such as those proven by Gödel and Rosser. A related point is that CTM involves, and is guilty of reinforcing, a misunderstanding of the concept of an algorithm THE INPUT IS BETTER; AND THE OUTPUT IS NOT A SELF-CONTAINED PRODUCT --IT IS JUST BLOATED AND INFERIOR VERSION OF THE INPUT YOU COCKSUCKING FRAUDULENT FAGGOT
