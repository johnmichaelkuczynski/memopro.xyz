3-STATEMENT MODEL FUNCTION - TEST RESULTS
Overall Assessment: FAIR (68%)
The Replit agent generated a structurally sound 3-statement model with proper linkages and roll-forwards, but with critical issues: zero formulas, balance sheet imbalance, and several missing components from the test input.

🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES
1. ZERO FORMULAS - CRITICAL (Same Issue as M&A)
SheetFormulas FoundAll 11 Sheets0
Impact: The model is entirely hardcoded values. Cannot be used for scenario analysis, sensitivity testing, or as a working financial model.
2. Balance Sheet Does Not Balance

The exact same $27.40M imbalance in every year suggests a systematic error in the model construction.

Root Cause: R&D is calculated at 6% of revenue ($51M) from Year 0, but test input specified 5% ($42.5M). The 1% difference ($8.5M) flows through to EBITDA and Net Income.

🔧 SPECIFICATION AMENDMENTS NEEDED

FORMULA REQUIREMENT (Critical - applies to ALL Finance Panel functions):

"MANDATORY: Every calculated cell MUST contain an Excel formula. After generating, verify formula count > 500 for 3-statement models. Zero formulas = FAILED output."


BALANCE SHEET VALIDATION:

"REQUIRED: Before finalizing, compute Assets - (Liabilities + Equity) for each year. If ≠ 0, identify and fix the error. Never output a model where the balance sheet doesn't balance."


INPUT ECHO-BACK:

"Before generating projections, list all historical values being used and compare to user input. Flag any discrepancies."


REQUIRED TABS:

"The model MUST include these specific tabs: [Assumptions, Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, Working Capital, PP&E Schedule, Debt Schedule, Depreciation Schedule, Equity Roll-Forward, Ratio Dashboard, Sensitivity Analysis]. Missing tabs = incomplete."




VERDICT
The 3-Statement Model function is 68% effective - significantly better than the M&A model (45%) but still critically flawed due to:

Zero formulas (fatal for a financial model)
Balance sheet doesn't balance (fundamental modeling error)
Some input values not correctly captured

The structural architecture is sound and the statement linkages work (cash ties, roll-forwards work), suggesting the underlying logic is correct but the execution has systematic issues.
