The LBO function is failing in three independent ways based on the Summit Industrial Services test input. These are parsing failures and propagation failures, not math errors. Below is exactly what the app is NOT doing that it should be doing.

1. PURCHASE PRICE AND DEAL-STRUCTURE VARIABLES ARE NOT BEING PARSED

The app is failing to extract the enterprise value from the sentence:

“Purchase Price: 7.0× LTM EBITDA of $100M (EV = $700M)”

Expected:

purchase_price = 700
Actual:

purchase_price = undefined

Because this value is undefined, the following fields are also undefined:

Senior Debt

Subordinated Debt

Sponsor Equity

Total Sources

Total Uses

Exit Enterprise Value

Exit Equity Value

Entry Leverage

Exit Leverage

Debt Paydown

These failures are all downstream of the missing purchase price parse.

2. EBITDA DOES NOT PROPAGATE BEYOND YEAR 1

The app successfully computes Year-1 EBITDA:

Revenue: $577.5M

EBITDA Margin: 18%

Expected EBITDA: $103.95M

Year-1 EBITDA output = correct

However, EBITDA for Years 2–5 all return undefined.

This means:

The EBITDA margin is parsed correctly

Revenue is forecast correctly

The function applying the margin to future-year revenues is not running after Year 1

This is a propagation failure inside the model logic.

3. DEBT SCHEDULE FAILS IMMEDIATELY AFTER SENIOR DEBT RETURNS UNDEFINED

Because Senior Debt is not parsed:

senior_debt = undefined

Interest expense cannot be computed

Mandatory amortization cannot be computed

Year-end senior debt balances become undefined from Year-1 onward

This causes:

Undefined interest

Undefined free cash flow adjustments

Undefined debt balances for all projected years

This is a direct consequence of the missing debt-sizing parse.

SUMMARY OF WHAT THE APP FAILED TO DO

Did not parse the purchase price (EV).

Did not parse debt multiples (4.0× Senior, 1.0× Sub).

Did not parse transaction fees.

Did not propagate EBITDA margin after Year-1.

Produced undefined senior debt balances beginning in Year-1.

Produced undefined exit valuation due entirely to undefined EV and debt balances.
