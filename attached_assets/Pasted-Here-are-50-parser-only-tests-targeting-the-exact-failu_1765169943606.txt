Here are 50 parser-only tests targeting the exact failure mode that breaks your finance engine:

✅ Unit conversion only
✅ No modeling
✅ Each test should output ONE number
The agent must convert everything into millions (M).
📌 RULE FOR THESE 50 TESTS

All outputs must be in millions.
Examples:

“$1.3B” → 1300

“$870m” → 870

“775 million” → 775

If the parser is correct, you will get 50 numbers that match exactly.
