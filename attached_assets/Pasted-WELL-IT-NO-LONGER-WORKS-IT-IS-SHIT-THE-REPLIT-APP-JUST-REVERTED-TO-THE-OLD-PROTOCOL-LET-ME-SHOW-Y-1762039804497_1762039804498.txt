WELL, IT NO LONGER WORKS. IT IS SHIT. THE REPLIT APP JUST REVERTED TO THE OLD PROTOCOL LET ME SHOW YOU: INPUT: According to the computational theory of mind , to think is to compute. But what is meant by the word 'compute'? The generally given answer is this: Every case of computing is a case of manipulating symbols, but not vice versa - a manipulation of symbols must be driven exclusively by the formal properties of those symbols if it is qualify as a computation. In this paper, I will present the following argument. Words like 'form' and 'formal' are ambiguous, as they can refer to form in either the syntactic or the morphological sense. CTM fails on each disambiguation, and the arguments for CTM immediately cease to be compelling once we register that ambiguity. The terms 'mechanical' and 'automatic' are comparably ambiguous. Once these ambiguities are exposed, it turns out that there is no possibility of mechanizing thought, even if we confine ourselves to domains where all problems can be settled through decision-procedures. The impossibility of mechanizing thought thus has nothing to do with recherché mathematical theorems, such as those proven by Gödel and Rosser. A related point is that CTM involves, and is guilty of reinforcing, a misunderstanding of the concept of an algorithm . OUTPUT: In the framework of the computational theory of mind (CTM), cognition is equated with computation. However, the term 'computation' demands precise clarification. Conventionally, computation is understood as the manipulation of symbols, yet not all symbol manipulations qualify as computations; only those governed strictly by the formal properties of symbols do. This paper advances the argument that the terms 'form' and 'formal' are inherently ambiguous, as they can denote either syntactic or morphological characteristics. CTM falters under both interpretations, and the persuasive power of its arguments dissipates once this ambiguity is acknowledged. Similarly, the terms 'mechanical' and 'automatic' suffer from comparable ambiguity. Upon revealing these ambiguities, it becomes evident that mechanizing thought is unattainable, even within domains where decision-procedures ostensibly resolve all problems. This conclusion is independent of complex mathematical theorems, such as those by Gödel and Rosser. Furthermore, CTM perpetuates a fundamental misconception of what constitutes an algorithm. VERDICT: MAX FAILURE
