# LBO Model Function - Complete Implementation Instructions

## Function Purpose
Accept natural language description of a leveraged buyout transaction, extract all relevant deal parameters, construct integrated financial projections with detailed debt schedules, calculate returns to equity sponsors, and generate a downloadable Excel file with working formulas, multiple financing scenarios, and sensitivity analysis on key value drivers.

## Input Processing Requirements

The function must parse natural language input and extract the following variables:

**Target Company Financials:**
- Current revenue (base year or LTM - Last Twelve Months)
- Revenue growth rates by year or year ranges
- EBITDA margin (current and/or target)
- Margin expansion timeline and trajectory
- Depreciation & Amortization as percentage of revenue or absolute values
- Capital Expenditures (CapEx) as percentage of revenue or absolute values
- Net Working Capital (NWC) requirements as percentage of revenue
- Tax rate

**Purchase Price and Valuation:**
- Purchase price (absolute $ or as EBITDA multiple)
- Entry EBITDA multiple (e.g., "10.5x LTM EBITDA")
- Entry year EBITDA base (LTM or specific year)
- Transaction costs and fees (as % of purchase price or absolute $)
- Management rollover equity (% or absolute $)

**Financing Structure (Sources of Funds):**
- Senior debt amount or multiple (e.g., "4.0x EBITDA")
- Senior debt interest rate
- Senior debt amortization schedule (% per year or specific amounts)
- Subordinated/Mezzanine debt amount or multiple
- Subordinated debt interest rate
- Subordinated debt terms (PIK vs cash, amortization)
- Revolving credit facility size and terms
- Sponsor equity contribution (amount or % of purchase price)
- Management equity rollover

**Operating Assumptions:**
- Revenue growth trajectory
- EBITDA margin improvement path
- CapEx as % of revenue
- NWC as % of revenue
- Tax rate

**Exit Assumptions:**
- Exit year (typically year 5)
- Exit EBITDA multiple
- Exit method (strategic sale, IPO, secondary buyout)

**Fee Structure:**
- Management fees (% of EBITDA or revenue annually)
- Transaction fees (% of purchase price, one-time)
- Monitoring fees from sponsor

## Calculation Requirements

The function must perform the following calculations with formulas (not hard-coded values):

**Sources and Uses of Funds:**

Sources:
1. Senior Debt = (Target EBITDA × Senior Debt Multiple) or absolute amount
2. Subordinated Debt = (Target EBITDA × Sub Debt Multiple) or absolute amount
3. Revolving Credit Facility = Available but typically drawn at $0 initially
4. Sponsor Equity = Purchase Price + Transaction Costs - Total Debt - Management Rollover
5. Management Rollover Equity = Specified amount or percentage

Uses:
1. Purchase Equity Value = Purchase Price
2. Refinancing Existing Debt = If specified
3. Transaction Fees = % of Purchase Price
4. Other Fees and Expenses = If specified
5. Total Uses = Sum of all uses (must equal Total Sources)

**Year-by-Year Operating Projections:**
1. Revenue = Previous Year Revenue × (1 + Growth Rate)
2. EBITDA = Revenue × EBITDA Margin
3. Less: D&A = Revenue × D&A Rate
4. EBIT = EBITDA - D&A
5. Less: Interest Expense = (Senior Debt Balance × Senior Rate) + (Sub Debt Balance × Sub Rate)
6. Less: Management Fees = EBITDA × Management Fee %
7. EBT (Earnings Before Tax) = EBIT - Interest - Management Fees
8. Less: Taxes = EBT × Tax Rate (tax shield from interest deduction)
9. Net Income = EBT - Taxes
10. Add back: D&A (non-cash)
11. Less: CapEx = Revenue × CapEx Rate
12. Less: Change in NWC = (Current Year NWC - Previous Year NWC)
13. Cash Flow Available for Debt Service = Net Income + D&A - CapEx - Δ NWC

**Debt Schedule:**

For each debt tranche (Senior, Subordinated):
1. Beginning Balance = Previous Year Ending Balance
2. Mandatory Amortization = Beginning Balance × Amortization %
3. Optional Prepayment = MIN(Available Cash After Mandatory, Remaining Balance)
4. Total Repayment = Mandatory Amortization + Optional Prepayment
5. Ending Balance = Beginning Balance - Total Repayment
6. Interest Expense = Average Balance × Interest Rate (or Beginning Balance × Rate)
7. Cash Interest Paid = Interest Expense (or reduced if PIK)

**Cash Flow Waterfall:**
1. Cash Available for Debt Service (from operations)
2. Less: Mandatory Amortization (Senior Debt first, then Sub Debt)
3. Less: Cash Interest Payments
4. Excess Cash = Remaining after mandatory payments
5. Optional Prepayment = Apply excess cash to debt (Senior first)
6. Cash to Equity = Any remaining excess cash after all debt paid

**Exit Valuation:**
1. Exit Year EBITDA = Year N EBITDA
2. Exit Enterprise Value = Exit EBITDA × Exit Multiple
3. Less: Remaining Debt (all tranches)
4. Exit Equity Value = Exit EV - Remaining Debt

**Returns Calculations:**
1. Sponsor Equity Invested = Initial equity contribution
2. Exit Equity Value to Sponsor = Exit Equity Value × (Sponsor % ownership)
3. Money Multiple (MOIC) = Exit Value / Initial Investment
4. IRR = Solve for rate where NPV of cash flows = 0
   - Year 0: -Initial Investment
   - Years 1-4: Dividends or recaps (if any)
   - Year 5: Exit proceeds
5. Management Equity Returns = Exit Equity Value × (Management % ownership)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
Create two-dimensional sensitivity tables showing:
- Sponsor IRR sensitivity to Exit Multiple (rows) and Revenue Growth (columns)
- Sponsor IRR sensitivity to Exit Multiple (rows) and Exit Year EBITDA Margin (columns)
- Exit Equity Value sensitivity to Exit Multiple and operational assumptions

## Error Handling

The function must validate:
- Total Sources = Total Uses (must balance exactly)
- Sponsor Equity > 0 (deal must be financeable)
- Debt / EBITDA ratios are reasonable (<8.0x typically)
- Interest coverage >1.0x in all years (company can service debt)
- Exit Multiple is reasonable (typically 6x-15x EBITDA)
- IRR calculation converges (cash flows must support return calculation)
- All debt is repaid or refinanced by exit
- Growth rates are reasonable (-20% to +100%)
- EBITDA margins are between 0% and 80%

If validation fails, return error message specifying which constraint is violated.

## Example Input

"I need an LBO model for RetailCo, a specialty retail chain. They're currently generating one point two billion dollars in annual revenue with LTM EBITDA of two hundred and eighty million dollars, giving them a twenty-three point three percent EBITDA margin. We're looking at acquiring the business at ten point five times LTM EBITDA, so that's a purchase price of two billion nine hundred and forty million dollars.

For the financing structure, we can get senior debt at four point zero times EBITDA, which would be one billion one hundred and twenty million dollars. The senior facility will carry a six percent interest rate with mandatory amortization of five percent of the original principal amount per year. We're also arranging subordinated debt at one point five times EBITDA, so that's four hundred and twenty million dollars, at an interest rate of eleven percent with no amortization until maturity. We'll have a one hundred million dollar revolving credit facility available at LIBOR plus three hundred basis points, call it five percent, though we don't expect to draw on it at close. The existing management team is rolling over sixty million dollars of equity. That means sponsor equity will be the remaining amount needed to get to our total purchase price.

Transaction fees and expenses will run about two percent of the purchase price. These should be included in the uses of funds.

On the operating side, I'm modeling relatively conservative growth given the mature retail market. Revenue growth of six percent in year one, seven percent in year two, then five percent in years three through five. EBITDA margins should improve from the current twenty-three point three percent to twenty-seven percent by year five through better inventory management and store productivity. Model this as linear margin expansion over the five-year period.

Depreciation and amortization will be five point five percent of revenue. CapEx requirements are four percent of revenue annually for store remodels and IT infrastructure. Net working capital is eight percent of revenue, typical for specialty retail. The company operates primarily in the US with a twenty-five percent corporate tax rate.

Management fees will be one percent of EBITDA annually, paid to the sponsor.

We're underwriting to a five-year hold period with an exit at nine point five times exit year EBITDA. Transaction costs at exit will be one percent of exit proceeds.

Please build the full LBO model with integrated financials, detailed debt schedules, and comprehensive sensitivity analysis on both exit multiple and revenue growth assumptions."

## File Delivery Specifications

**File format:** .xlsx (Excel 2016 or later)
**File size:** Typically 400-800 KB (larger than DCF due to debt schedules)
**Compatibility:** Excel 2016+, Google Sheets (with minor formatting differences)
**Download method:** Direct download link generated immediately upon completion
**File naming convention:** [CompanyName]_LBO_Model_[Date].xlsx

All formulas must remain intact and editable. No values should be hard-coded except in the blue-font assumption cells. All calculation cells must contain formulas that reference assumption cells or other calculated cells. The debt schedules must dynamically calculate optional prepayments based on available cash flow. The returns calculations must use XIRR function for accurate IRR with irregular timing. All sensitivity tables must use data table functionality or equivalent to enable dynamic recalculation.

The model should include error checks:
- Sources = Uses validation
- Positive sponsor equity check
- Interest coverage >1.0x check
- IRR convergence validation
- Debt balance never negative check
