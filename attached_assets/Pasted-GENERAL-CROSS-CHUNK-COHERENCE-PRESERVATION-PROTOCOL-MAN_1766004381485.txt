GENERAL CROSS-CHUNK COHERENCE PRESERVATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

Problem:
Texts exceeding ~1000 words are chunked. Coherence is being evaluated locally, but coherence is a state that evolves across chunks. This causes silent degradation across all coherence modes.

Rule 0 (Non-negotiable):
No coherence function may operate on a chunk without an explicit, persistent global state for the selected coherence dimension.

STEP 1 — INITIALIZE A GLOBAL COHERENCE STATE (GCS)

Before chunk processing, extract and store a Global Coherence State specific to the selected coherence mode.

The GCS is not a summary and not a contradiction list.
It is a state vector that must be carried forward.

GCS contents by coherence mode:

Logical Consistency

Propositions already asserted

Negations already ruled out

Logical Cohesiveness

Current argument position (premise / development / conclusion)

Active claims requiring downstream support

Scientific / Explanatory

Active causal variables

Causal level (mechanism / system / policy)

Feedback loops already introduced

Thematic / Psychological

Dominant affect

Emotional trajectory (stable / escalating / resolving)

Instructional

Steps already given

Preconditions assumed satisfied

Goal state

Motivational

Direction of motivation (encourage / warn / pressure / reassure)

Intensity trend

Mathematical (Proof Validity)

Assumptions in force

Proof strategy (direct / contradiction / induction)

Lemmas established

Philosophical (Conceptual Rigor)

Core concepts with their roles

Distinctions already drawn

Dialectical position occupied

Store this GCS once per run.

STEP 2 — PROCESS EACH CHUNK AS A STATE TRANSITION

Each chunk must be treated as a transition from GCS_n → GCS_n+1.

The model must answer only this question:

Does this chunk continue, refine, or deliberately shift the existing coherence state — or does it unintentionally reset, dilute, or scramble it?

Local quality is irrelevant unless it affects the state.

STEP 3 — UPDATE THE GCS AFTER EACH CHUNK

After evaluating a chunk:

Update the GCS with:

newly activated elements

resolved elements

shifts in level, tone, or structure

Never allow a chunk to re-initialize the state implicitly.

STEP 4 — FAILURE DETECTION (MODE-INDEPENDENT)

Flag coherence degradation when:

the state is re-asserted instead of advanced

the explanatory / argumentative / motivational level silently changes

concepts or goals are reused with altered roles

progress stalls via repetition rather than development

This applies across all coherence modes.

STEP 5 — OUTPUT RULE (NO NULLS)

For each chunk, return:

State preserved / weakened / shifted

Exact dimension of state failure (level, trajectory, assumption, role)

Nearest adjacent repair that restores state continuity

Never return:

“incoherent”

“cannot evaluate”

global judgments

CORE PRINCIPLE (ENFORCE EVERYWHERE)

Coherence is not agreement or non-contradiction.
Coherence is continuity of state under transformation.

Any function that does not track state across chunks is invalid.

If you implement this protocol, every coherence function becomes structurally sound under chunking.
