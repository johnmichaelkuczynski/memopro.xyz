ADD THIS: EXEMPLAR-DRIVEN COHERENCE ACROSS CHUNKS (MANDATORY)
Rule A — Every coherence mode must use:

a State Template (what to track), and

a Worked Example (what “preserved” vs “broken” looks like).

If either is missing, the implementation is invalid.

1) LOGICAL CONSISTENCY (NON-CONTRADICTION ONLY)
State Template (LC_STATE)

assertions: list of atomic claims already asserted

negations: list of claims explicitly denied

disjoint_pairs: pairs that cannot both be true in this text’s frame

Worked Example

Chunk 1: “Levees reduce small floods.” → assertions += [levees_reduce_small_floods]
Chunk 3: “Levees do not reduce small floods.” → contradiction → fail
Chunk 3: “Levees reduce small floods but increase catastrophic risk.” → pass (not contradiction)

2) LOGICAL COHESIVENESS (ARGUMENT STRUCTURE)
State Template (LCH_STATE)

thesis: what the argument is trying to establish

support_queue: claims promised but not yet supported

current_stage: setup | support | objection | reply | synthesis | conclusion

bridge_required: what must connect prior chunk to next

Worked Example

Chunk 1 thesis: “Flood control fails due to feedback loops.”
Chunk 2: adds an example of treadmill effect → advances support → pass
Chunk 3: restates “feedback loops exist” with no new support → stall → fail
Chunk 4: introduces “insurance incentives” without linking to thesis → missing bridge → fail unless it explicitly connects: “Insurance subsidies amplify the treadmill by…”

3) SCIENTIFIC / EXPLANATORY (ALIGNS WITH NATURAL LAW; MECHANISM CONTINUITY)
State Template (SCI_STATE)

causal_graph_nodes: variables named so far (runoff, imperviousness, peak flow, etc.)

causal_edges: stated mechanisms (imperviousness → runoff ↑)

level: physical/hydrologic | socio-economic | institutional | mixed

active_feedback_loops: named loops that must remain “live” once introduced

mechanism_requirements: for each major claim: what mechanism was given?

Worked Example (this is the key one you were missing)

Chunk 1 introduces: “impervious surfaces ↑ → infiltration ↓ → runoff ↑”
SCI_STATE must store that as edges.

Next chunk says: “Drainage expansion induces development.”
To be explanatorily coherent, it must carry through mechanism:

“Drainage capacity ↑ → perceived risk ↓ or buildable land ↑ → development ↑ → imperviousness ↑ → runoff ↑”
If the chunk merely says “feedback loops happen” without edges, that is fail (it resets from mechanism to slogan).

Pass condition: once a loop is introduced, later chunks must either:

extend it, or

use it to explain a new phenomenon, or

explicitly close it (“this loop dominates short-term outcomes but is offset by…”)

4) THEMATIC / PSYCHOLOGICAL (EMOTIONAL & MOOD FLOW)
State Template (THEME_STATE)

dominant_affect: anxious | sober | outraged | hopeful | etc.

tempo: calm | urgent | escalating | resolving

stance: analytic | warning | elegiac | motivational | etc.

Worked Example

Chunk 1 is sober/analytic.
Chunk 2 shifts to alarmist moralizing (“disastrous betrayal…”) with no ramp → fail
Chunk 2 shifts to cautionary warning but signals it (“This is where the risk becomes political…”) → pass

5) INSTRUCTIONAL (CLEAR, ACTIONABLE MESSAGE)
State Template (INST_STATE)

goal: the target outcome the instructions aim at

steps_done: ordered steps already provided

prereqs: assumptions required before later steps

open_loops: steps promised but not yet given

Worked Example

Chunk 1: Step 1 “Map drainage basins.” Step 2 “Identify choke points.”
Chunk 2 jumps to “Implement permeable pavement” without prerequisites (“identify candidate corridors”) → fail
Chunk 2 includes missing prereq step → pass

6) MOTIVATIONAL (CONSISTENT EMOTIONAL DIRECTION)
State Template (MOT_STATE)

direction: encourage | pressure | reassure | challenge | warn

intensity: 1–5

target: who is being motivated (reader, policymaker, student)

Worked Example

Chunk 1: reassure (2/5) “manageable with planning”
Chunk 2: doom (5/5) “hopeless unless revolution” → reversal → fail
Chunk 2: escalate to urgency (3/5) with continuity → pass

7) MATHEMATICAL (PROOF VALIDITY)
State Template (MATH_STATE)

givens: axioms/assumptions introduced

proved: lemmas established

goal: theorem statement

proof_method: direct | contradiction | induction

dependencies: what each step relies on

Worked Example

Chunk 1 defines assumption A and aims to prove T.
Chunk 2 uses lemma L without proving it or citing it as known → fail
Chunk 2 proves L then uses it → pass

8) PHILOSOPHICAL (CONCEPTUAL RIGOR; DIALECTICAL ENGAGEMENT)
State Template (PHIL_STATE)

core_concepts: term → role (e.g., “coherence” as constraint satisfaction vs narrative unity)

distinctions: A vs B (proximate vs structural; prediction vs explanation)

dialectic: objections raised, replies pending

no_equivocation: list of terms that must not silently change meaning

Worked Example

Chunk 1: “structural cause” = policy/institutional determinants.
Chunk 3 uses “structural” to mean “physical infrastructure” → equivocation → fail
Chunk 3 explicitly marks shift (“structural in the engineering sense”) → pass

9) AUTO-DETECT
Rule

Auto-detect must choose one mode based on features of the text, then apply that mode’s State Template + Worked Example logic. No blending.

Implementation Requirement (Hard)

For each coherence mode, implement:

init_state(text_first_chunk) -> STATE

evaluate_chunk(chunk, STATE) -> {status, reasons, state_update}

update_state(STATE, state_update) -> STATE

If the app does not maintain a typed STATE per mode, it cannot preserve cross-chunk coherence.
