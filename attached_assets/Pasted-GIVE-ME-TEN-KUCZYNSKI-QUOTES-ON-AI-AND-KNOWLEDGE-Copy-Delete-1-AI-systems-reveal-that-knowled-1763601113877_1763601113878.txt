1. "AI systems reveal that knowledge requires beliefs formed through reliable processes that systematically track truth. This vindicates reliabilist theories of knowledge over traditional JTB (justified true belief) accounts." (Essay 11)

2. "AI development vindicates pragmatism's core insight that knowledge acquisition is fundamentally interactive rather than passive. AI systems learn through active engagement with their environment, validating pragmatist emphasis on the practical, interactive nature of inquiry." (Essay 21: Pragmatism and AI)

3. "AI reveals that all knowledge, even 'objective' knowledge, begins from perspectival, interaction-based data driven by practical interests. There is no view from nowhere - even AI's knowledge is grounded in its interactions with reality." (Essay 21)

4. "AI learning systems demonstrate a solution to the Gettier problem by showing that genuine knowledge requires not just justified true belief but also that the justification tracks truth through a reliable causal-computational process." (Essay 11: AI and Gettier Problem)

5. "AI is behavioral prosthesis of collective intelligence. Does not think but remembers how thinking sounds. Not conscious but expresses embedded intelligence from training." (The Pianist's Hand)

6. "System echoing thousands of human intelligences - can track arguments, respond insightfully because shaped by inner lives." (The Pianist's Hand)

7. "Reason AI can say something new: shaped by inner lives, including yours if you teach it." (The Pianist's Hand)

8. "AI reveals that knowledge acquisition is neither pure discovery of pre-existing facts (naive realism) nor pure construction from experience (radical constructivism). It involves interaction between innate processing architecture and environmental structure." (Essay 5)

9. "AI systems demonstrate that knowledge acquisition requires both innate structure (rationalist element) and learning from data (empiricist element). Neither pure rationalism nor pure empiricism can account for AI's success." (Essay 5: AI Resolves Epistemological Debates)

10. "Knowledge of unobservables is not only possible but routine when proper theoretical frameworks are in place. AI systems successfully infer unobservable entities from observable patterns." (Essay 5)
