- Amortization period for intangibles
- Step-up in asset basis (if applicable)
- Deferred tax impacts

## Calculation Requirements

The function must perform the following calculations with formulas (not hard-coded values):

**Standalone Financial Projections:**

For Acquirer (Years 1-5):
1. Revenue = Previous Year × (1 + Growth Rate)
2. EBITDA = Revenue × EBITDA Margin
3. Less: D&A
4. EBIT = EBITDA - D&A
5. Less: Interest Expense
6. EBT = EBIT - Interest
7. Less: Taxes = EBT × Tax Rate
8. Net Income = EBT - Taxes
9. Shares Outstanding (if no dilution)
10. EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding

For Target (Years 1-5):
- Same calculation structure as acquirer
- Reflects standalone projections without deal

**Transaction Accounting:**

Purchase Price Allocation:
1. Total Purchase Price (including assumed debt if applicable)
2. Less: Target's Book Value of Equity
3. Equals: Excess Purchase Price
4. Allocate excess to:
   - Identifiable Intangible Assets (customer relationships, technology, brand)
   - Goodwill (residual)
5. Additional D&A from intangibles = Intangibles / Amortization Period

Sources of Funds:
1. Cash from Balance Sheet
2. New Debt Issuance
3. Stock Consideration (Shares × Acquirer Stock Price)
4. Total Sources

Uses of Funds:
1. Target Equity Value
2. Target Net Debt (Debt - Cash assumed/refinanced)
3. Transaction Fees
4. Total Uses

**Synergy Calculations:**

Revenue Synergies by Year:
1. Total Revenue Synergies (target amount)
2. Year 1 = Total × Phase-in %
3. Year 2 = Total × Cumulative Phase-in %
4. Continue through full realization

Cost Synergies by Year:
1. Total Cost Synergies (EBITDA improvement)
2. Year 1 = Total × Phase-in %
3. Continue through full realization

Integration Costs by Year:
1. Total One-Time Costs
2. Allocate by year based on timing assumptions
3. These reduce Net Income but may be excluded from adjusted EPS

**Pro Forma Combined Projections:**

Revenue:
1. Acquirer Standalone Revenue
2. Plus: Target Standalone Revenue
3. Plus: Revenue Synergies (phased-in)
4. Less: Revenue Dis-synergies (if any - customer attrition, etc.)
5. Pro Forma Combined Revenue

EBITDA:
1. Acquirer Standalone EBITDA
2. Plus: Target Standalone EBITDA
3. Plus: Cost Synergies (phased-in)
4. Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (before integration costs)

D&A:
1. Acquirer Standalone D&A
2. Plus: Target Standalone D&A
3. Plus: Additional D&A from Purchase Price Allocation
4. Pro Forma Combined D&A

EBIT:
1. Pro Forma EBITDA - Pro Forma D&A

Interest Expense:
1. Acquirer Existing Interest
2. Plus: Target Assumed/Refinanced Debt Interest
3. Plus: New Debt Interest (for acquisition financing)
4. Pro Forma Combined Interest

Net Income:
1. Pro Forma EBIT - Pro Forma Interest - Pro Forma Taxes
2. Less: Integration Costs (after-tax)
3. Pro Forma Net Income

**Share Count Calculation:**

If Stock Consideration:
1. Stock Portion of Purchase Price
2. Divided by: Acquirer Stock Price
3. Equals: New Shares Issued
4. Pro Forma Shares = Existing Acquirer Shares + New Shares

If Cash Consideration:
1. Pro Forma Shares = Existing Acquirer Shares (no dilution)

**Accretion/Dilution Analysis:**

For each year:
1. Acquirer Standalone EPS = Standalone Net Income / Standalone Shares
2. Pro Forma EPS = Pro Forma Net Income / Pro Forma Shares
3. EPS Impact = Pro Forma EPS - Standalone EPS
4. % Accretion/(Dilution) = (Pro Forma EPS / Standalone EPS) - 1
5. Positive % = Accretive (increases EPS)
6. Negative % = Dilutive (decreases EPS)

**Returns Metrics:**

1. ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) = NOPAT / Invested Capital
2. Payback Period = Purchase Price / Annual Synergies
3. NPV of Synergies = PV of synergy cash flows
4. Value Creation = NPV of Synergies - Purchase Price Premium

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

1. Accretion/Dilution sensitivity to Purchase Price and Synergy Realization
2. Accretion/Dilution sensitivity to Purchase Price and Revenue Growth
3. NPV sensitivity to Cost of Capital and Synergy Amount
4. Pro Forma EPS sensitivity across multiple variables

## Error Handling

The function must validate:
- Sources = Uses (must balance exactly)
- Purchase price is positive
- Synergies are reasonable (typically <30% of target EBITDA for cost synergies)
- Integration costs are reasonable (typically 5-15% of purchase price)
- Tax rates are between 0% and 50%
- Share prices are positive
- Shares outstanding are positive
- Growth rates are reasonable (-20% to +100%)
- Margins are between 0% and 100%
- Goodwill calculation is positive (purchase price > net assets)

If validation fails, return error message specifying which constraint is violated.

## Example Input

"Build me an M&A model for FinTech Solutions acquiring PaymentPro. FinTech Solutions is the acquirer - they're a publicly traded payment processing company currently doing four point two billion dollars in annual revenue with thirteen percent EBITDA margins, so that's five hundred and forty-six million in EBITDA. They're growing revenue at eight percent per year. Their D&A runs at about three percent of revenue. They have two hundred million in annual interest expense on three billion dollars of debt, which implies a six point seven percent average interest rate. They're in a twenty-four percent tax jurisdiction. They have four hundred and fifty million shares outstanding trading at sixty-eight dollars per share, giving them a thirty point six billion dollar market cap. Their current EPS is two dollars and eighty cents, so they're trading at about twenty-four times earnings.

PaymentPro is the target company - a private payment gateway provider doing nine hundred million in revenue with higher margins at nineteen percent EBITDA, so that's one hundred and seventy-one million in EBITDA. They're growing at twelve percent annually, faster than FinTech. Their D&A is two point five percent of revenue. They have forty million in interest expense on six hundred million of debt at a blended rate of six point six seven percent. Same tax rate of twenty-four percent since they're also US-based.

We're proposing to acquire PaymentPro for two point four billion dollars in enterprise value, which represents fourteen times their LTM EBITDA - a meaningful premium given the strategic value. That enterprise value translates to one point eight billion in equity value after accounting for their six hundred million in net debt that we'll be refinancing.

The deal structure will be seventy percent cash and thirty percent stock. So that's one point two six billion in cash and five hundred and forty million in stock consideration. For the cash portion, we'll use three hundred million from our balance sheet and raise nine hundred and sixty million in new debt at seven point five percent interest. The stock portion means we'll be issuing new shares at our current stock price of sixty-eight dollars, which comes out to about seven point nine million new shares.

Transaction fees including investment banking, legal, and accounting will run about one point five percent of the enterprise value, so approximately thirty-six million dollars.

On synergies, we see significant opportunities. Revenue synergies should be about one hundred and twenty million annually at full run-rate from cross-selling FinTech's enterprise payment solutions to PaymentPro's mid-market customer base. We'll realize thirty percent of these in year one, sixty percent in year two, and fully by year three.

Cost synergies are even more compelling at one hundred and eighty million annually from consolidating redundant technology platforms, eliminating duplicate corporate functions, and leveraging our larger scale with vendors. These will phase in at forty percent in year one, seventy percent in year two, and one hundred percent by year three.

Integration costs will be substantial given the technology platform consolidation required. Budget two hundred and fifty million total: one hundred and twenty million in year one for systems integration and severance, ninety million in year two for facility consolidation and remaining IT work, and forty million in year three for final integration activities and brand unification.

For the purchase price allocation, assume we'll identify one hundred and fifty million in customer relationship intangibles with a ten-year amortization period, and two hundred million in developed technology intangibles with a seven-year life. The residual will be goodwill.

Please build the full M&A model with standalone projections for both companies, detailed pro forma combined financials, comprehensive accretion-dilution analysis, and sensitivity tables showing how accretion changes with different purchase prices and synergy realization rates. I want to see this over a five-year projection period."

All formulas must remain intact and editable. No values should be hard-coded except in the blue-font assumption cells. All calculation cells must contain formulas that reference assumption cells or other calculated cells. The accretion/dilution analysis must dynamically recalculate based on changes to purchase price, synergies, or financing assumptions. All sensitivity tables must use data table functionality to enable dynamic recalculation across all scenarios.

The model should include error checks:
- Sources = Uses validation
- Positive EPS check (both standalone and pro forma)
- Reasonable synergy assumptions (cost synergies typically <40% of target EBITDA)
- Goodwill calculation is positive
- Share count calculations are accurate (dilution math)
- Tax rate validation (0-50%)
