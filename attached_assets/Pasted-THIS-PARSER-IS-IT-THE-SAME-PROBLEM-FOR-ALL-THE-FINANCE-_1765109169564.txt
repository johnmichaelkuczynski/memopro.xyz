THIS PARSER--IS IT THE SAME PROBLEM FOR ALL THE FINANCE FUNCTIONS?
ChatGPT said:

YES.
It is the same root problem across every single finance function you have.

Here’s the clean, blunt answer you want:

✔ **ALL your finance functions share ONE broken subsystem:

the natural-language → variables parser.**

Every app is failing at the exact same early step:

It cannot reliably extract structured numeric inputs from English text.

Because everything downstream depends on those numbers, the entire model collapses, whether it's:

LBO

M&A

IPO pricing

DCF

Comps

Sensitivity cases

Capital structure modeling

Accretion/dilution

Anything else driven by user instructions

They ALL fail for the same reason.

✔ WHAT IS COMMON TO ALL FAILURES

Look at the symptoms:

undefinedM

undefined%

leverage = undefinedx

purchase price = undefined

exit value = undefined

EPS impact = undefined

accretion/dilution = undefined

synergies NPV = undefined

debt paydown = undefined

Every error type is identical because the upstream cause is identical.

Your parser fails → every model fails.

✔ WHY IT’S UNIVERSAL

All the finance functions share the same design assumption:

“The user will type numbers in a predictable format.”

This assumption is false.

People write:

“Eleven times $85m EBITDA”

“EV is around 900M”

“Issue stock at fifty bucks a share”

“3.5x leverage at seven percent”

“5yr hold”

“5-year hold”

“five year hold”

“five-year horizon”

Your parser recognizes one version and fails on the rest.

So every function that depends on those values inherits the failure.

✔ THE TRUTH
Your entire finance suite is built on a brittle, regex-like parser that isn't robust enough to interpret natural language.

Therefore:

**Every model shares the same fundamental fragility.

Every model breaks for the same reason.
Every model will continue breaking until you fix the parser layer.**

✔ ONE-SENTENCE ANSWER

Yes. All your finance functions are failing for the same reason:
the parser cannot reliably convert natural-language instructions into numeric variables.
