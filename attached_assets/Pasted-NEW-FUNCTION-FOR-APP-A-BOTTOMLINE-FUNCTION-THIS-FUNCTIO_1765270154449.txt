NEW FUNCTION FOR APP: A BOTTOMLINE FUNCTION (THIS FUNCTION IS PART OF THE TEXT MODEL VALIDATOR SUITE). 
HOW IT WORKS: 
THREE WAYS WAYS: 
WAY 1: USER RUNS ALL FIVE FUNCTIONS ON HIS APP (RECONSTRUCTION/ISOMORPHISM/ETC.). 
THEN THE USER SAYS TO THE APP (IN A SPECIAL INPUT BOX): HERE IS MY OBJECTIVE; HERE IS WHO I AM TALKING TO; HERE IS THE IDEA I WANT TO CONVINCE THEM OF; HERE IS THE LENGTH I WANT; HERE IS THE TONE I WANT; HERE IS WHAT I WANT EMPHASIZED ETC. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE USER IS A LOW-LEVEL PERSON A PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM, AND HE HAS AN IDEA THAT HE IS TRYING TO GET HIS BOSS TO IMPLEMENT, HE SAYS TAHT TO THE APP, AND HE ALSO SAYS HOW LONG HE WANTS THE PITCH TO BE, WHAT THE TONE SHOULD BE, HOW MATHEMATICAL (OR INFORMAL) IT SHOULD BE, ETC. THEN--HAVING SPECIFIED ALL THAT--HE HITS A BUTTON, AND--ON THE BASIS OF THOSE CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS AND ALSO ON THE BASIS OF THE FIVE-FUNCTION REVIEW IT JUST DID--IT GIVES HIM EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS. 


WAY 2: THE SAME AS WAY 1 EXCEPT THAT THE USER ONLYK RUNS SOME (NOT ALL) OF THE FIVE FUNCTIONS; E.G. THE USER ONLY RUNS RECONSTRUCTION, OR HE ONLY RUNS RECONSTRUCTION AND MATH+TRUTH. 

WAY 3: SAME AS WAY 2 EXCEPT THAT THE USER DOES NOT FIRST RUN ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS; THE APP JUST 'RAW DOGS' IT. 

FOR ALL THREE WAYS, THE BASIC WORKFLOW IS THE SAME:

INPUT: THE USER'S HALF-BAKED BULLSHIT. 
INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT: THE FIVE FUNCTION ANALYSIS (RECONSTRUCTION/ANALYSIS/ETC.) 
FINAL OUTPUT: THE CUSTOMIZED, FINAL PRODUCT THAT THE USER WILL DELIVER TO THE INTENDED AUDIENCE (THE BOX, THE CLIENT, THE POLICY MAKER, THE STUDENT, THE PROFESSOR, ETC.)

IMPORTANT: IF THE USER GOES WITH WAY 1 OR WAY 2, THE APP, WHEN GENERATING THE FINAL OUTPUT, WILL NOT NECESSARILY WEIGHT THE INTERMEDIATE OUTPUTS THE SAME WHEN GENERATING THE FINAL OUTPUT (E.G. IF THE USER RUNS ISOMORPHISM, RECONSTRUCTION, AND MATH+TRUTH, OR IF HE RUNS ALL FIVE FUNCTIONS, IT WILL NOT NECESSARILY GIVE EQUAL WEIGHT TO EACH OF THOSE FUNCTIONS WHEN GENERATING); RATHER, THE APP WILL GIVE MORE WEIGHT TO THOSE OUTPUTS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE USER'S STATED OBJECTIVES AND ALSO TO THE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE IPMLICIT IN THE NATURE OF THE INPUT.
