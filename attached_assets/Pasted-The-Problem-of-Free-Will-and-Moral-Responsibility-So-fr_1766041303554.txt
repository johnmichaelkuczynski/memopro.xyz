The Problem of Free Will and Moral Responsibility

So free will is this thing that philosophers have been arguing about forever. Basically the question is whether we really choose our actions or whether everything is determined. It matters because if we don't have free will then maybe we can't be blamed for anything. But that seems wrong because we do blame people and it seems like we should.

Determinism is the idea that everything that happens is caused by prior events according to laws of nature. So if you knew the complete state of the universe at one time and all the laws, you could predict everything that would happen. Laplace's demon is this thought experiment about a being that could do this. The implication is that your choices are just the result of prior causes going back to before you were born.

But wait quantum mechanics shows that not everything is determined right? There's randomness at the quantum level. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says you can't know both position and momentum precisely. And radioactive decay is random. So maybe determinism is false. But actually this doesn't help with free will because randomness isn't freedom either. If your choices are random that's not the same as being in control.

Actually I should define free will better. There are different conceptions. Libertarian free will (not the political kind) says we have a special kind of causation that isn't determined by prior events. Agent causation is the idea that agents cause actions without being caused to do so by prior events. This seems to give us what we want but it's pretty mysterious. How does agent causation work? It seems to violate the causal closure of the physical world.

Compatibilism is probably the most popular view among philosophers. It says free will is compatible with determinism. The key move is redefining what free will means. Instead of requiring that you could have done otherwise in exactly the same circumstances, free will just means acting according to your own desires without external constraint. So if you want coffee and nothing stops you from getting coffee, you freely choose coffee, even if your desire for coffee was determined by prior events.

Harry Frankfurt came up with these cases that challenge the idea that free will requires being able to do otherwise. Imagine there's a neuroscientist who will intervene if you're about to choose A and make you choose B instead. But you choose B on your own so the neuroscientist never intervenes. Intuitively you seem responsible for choosing B even though you couldn't have done otherwise. This suggests that the ability to do otherwise isn't necessary for moral responsibility.

Oh I should talk about what moral responsibility even means. It's not just about causation because we don't hold rocks responsible for falling on people. It seems to involve something like desert, the idea that people deserve praise or blame for their actions. Strawson talked about reactive attitudes like resentment and gratitude. Maybe responsibility is about when these attitudes are appropriate rather than about metaphysical freedom.

The consequence argument is an argument against compatibilism. It goes something like: if determinism is true, then our actions are consequences of laws of nature and events in the remote past. We have no control over the laws of nature or the remote past. Therefore we have no control over our actions. This seems pretty compelling but compatibilists have responses. Some deny that we need control over the remote past. Others redefine control in ways that don't require this.

Actually neuroscience is relevant here. Libet's experiments showed that brain activity precedes conscious awareness of decisions. The readiness potential appears before subjects report deciding to move. This has been interpreted as showing that our conscious sense of deciding is an illusion. But the experiments are controversial and there are many criticisms. The tasks are very simple and artificial. The timing of conscious awareness is hard to measure. And even if unconscious brain processes initiate actions, conscious processes might still be able to veto them.

I want to go back to moral responsibility because that's what really matters practically. Even if libertarian free will doesn't exist, we might still have good reasons to hold people responsible. Responsibility practices might be justified by their consequences, like deterrence and rehabilitation, rather than by desert. This is a forward-looking rather than backward-looking justification. But it seems to miss something. When we blame someone we're not just trying to change future behavior. We think they actually deserve blame.

Hard determinism says determinism is true and incompatible with free will, so we don't have free will. Hard incompatibilists like Derk Pereboom argue we should revise our responsibility practices in light of this. We shouldn't feel resentment or indignation because people couldn't have done otherwise. But we can still quarantine dangerous people for protection, just not as punishment they deserve.

P.F. Strawson had a different approach. He said even if determinism is true, we couldn't give up reactive attitudes because they're too central to human relationships. Blaming and praising and resenting and being grateful are part of what it means to relate to other people as people rather than as objects. So questions about metaphysical determinism are kind of beside the point. Responsibility is grounded in social practices not metaphysics.

Speaking of social practices, there's research on how ordinary people think about free will. Experimental philosophy studies folk intuitions. Some studies show that people have incompatibilist intuitions, thinking that if determinism is true then free will doesn't exist. Other studies show compatibilist intuitions. It might depend on how abstract or concrete the cases are. This research is interesting but doesn't settle the philosophical questions.

I haven't mentioned fatalism which is different from determinism. Fatalism says the future is fixed regardless of what we do. Like Oedipus was fated to kill his father no matter what. Determinism just says the future is fixed given the past and laws, but our actions are part of the causal chain that determines the future. So determinism doesn't imply that our choices don't matter. They do matter, they just couldn't have been different given prior causes.

What about manipulation cases? If someone is brainwashed or manipulated, we don't hold them fully responsible. But what's the difference between manipulation and ordinary upbringing? Both shape your values and desires through processes you didn't choose. This is the manipulation argument against compatibilism. If brainwashing undermines responsibility, and there's no principled difference between brainwashing and normal development, then normal development also undermines responsibility.

Compatibilists respond that there are differences. Manipulation typically involves bypassing rational capacities while normal development works through them. Or manipulation makes you responsive to the wrong reasons. But these responses are controversial. It's not obvious that the differences are principled enough to bear the weight placed on them.

Let me say something about free will and science more broadly. Some people think science has shown we don't have free will. Neuroscientists sometimes say this. But it's not clear what scientific finding could show this. Science discovers causes of behavior. But compatibilism already accepts that behavior has causes. The claim that we lack free will is a philosophical interpretation of the science not a scientific finding itself.

Actually there's also the question of reasons versus causes. Acting for reasons seems different from being caused. When I believe the conclusion of an argument because of the premises, that seems like a rational relationship not just a causal one. Maybe free will requires acting for reasons. But reasons can also be causes. Davidson argued that reasons are causes. This doesn't solve the free will problem but it's relevant to understanding agency.

I realize I've been jumping around. Let me try to summarize the main positions. Libertarians say we have free will and it's incompatible with determinism and determinism is false. Hard determinists say determinism is true and incompatible with free will so we don't have free will. Compatibilists say determinism might be true but it's compatible with free will so we might still have free will. There are also hard incompatibilists who say free will is incompatible with both determinism and indeterminism so we don't have it either way.

The practical upshot is unclear. Even if hard incompatibilism is true, we probably can't just stop having reactive attitudes. But maybe we should try to moderate them. Maybe we should focus criminal justice more on prevention and rehabilitation than retribution. Maybe we should be more forgiving and less judgmental generally. Or maybe our current practices are fine because they serve important functions regardless of metaphysics.

One more thing about Frankfurt cases. There are different versions and lots of technical debate about whether they really show what they claim to show. The flicker of freedom objection says there's always some alternative the agent could have done, even if it's just trying to resist. Some philosophers think the cases work and some don't. It's a big literature.

Also I should mention that some philosophers think the whole debate is confused or not important. Maybe the concept of free will is incoherent. Or maybe it's a purely verbal dispute. Or maybe what matters practically doesn't depend on how the metaphysical question is resolved. These deflationary views are minority positions but worth knowing about.

In conclusion, free will is complicated. The main question is whether we have the kind of freedom required for moral responsibility. Compatibilists say yes, even if determinism is true. Incompatibilists say no, we need something more. The debate continues with no consensus in sight. But the practical implications might not be as dramatic as they first appear, since our practices of holding people responsible probably won't change much regardless of which philosophical view is correct.
