INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT AGENT — M&A MODEL IS NOT PARSING CRITICAL INPUTS

The M&A model is failing for the same reason the LBO model failed:
the parser is not extracting core transaction parameters from the user input.

Below is a precise list of what the app is NOT doing that it MUST do, with concrete examples.

1. It is NOT parsing the purchase price into usable numeric fields.

Example input:
“Purchase Price: 11.0× LTM EBITDA of $85M (Equity Value = $935M).”
Expected:

purchase_price = 935
Actual:

purchase_price = undefined

This cascades into undefined accretion/dilution.

2. It is NOT parsing the consideration mix (cash vs. stock).

Example:
“70% cash, 30% stock.”
Expected:

cash_portion = 0.70

stock_portion = 0.30
Actual:

Both undefined → model cannot calculate shares issued or EPS impact.

3. It is NOT parsing new debt financing.

Example:
“$500M new debt at 6.25% interest.”
Expected:

new_debt = 500

interest_rate = 0.0625
Actual:

new_debt = undefined

interest_rate = undefined

This breaks accretion/dilution, NPV of synergies, and leverage.

4. It is NOT parsing the buyer share price for stock issuance.

Example:
“Buyer share price = $50.”
Expected:

share_price = 50
Actual:

share_price = undefined
This makes share issuance impossible → EPS = undefined → accretion/dilution = undefined%.

5. It is NOT parsing the synergy timing or amounts into structured fields.

Example:

“Cost synergies: $40M annually”

“Revenue synergies: $25M incremental revenue per year”
Expected:

cost_synergies = 40

revenue_synergies = 25
Actual:

Synergies appear only in output headers; NPV is undefinedM.

6. It is NOT parsing the integration cost.

Example:
“One-time integration cost: $30M.”
Expected:

integration_cost = 30
Actual:

integration_cost = undefined

7. It is NOT parsing the forecast period.

Example:
“Model accretion/dilution over a 5-year forecast.”
Expected:

forecast_years = 5
Actual:

forecast_years = undefined

8. All EPS calculations are failing because shares outstanding and new shares issued are not being parsed.

Examples:

“Shares outstanding: 160M”

“Issue new shares accordingly.”

Expected:

old_shares = 160

new_shares = purchase_price × stock_portion ÷ share_price

Actual:

Both undefined → EPS and accretion/dilution = undefined%.

SYMPTOMS CAUSED BY THESE FAILURES

Accretion/dilution outputs = undefined%

NPV of synergies = undefinedM

Share issuance cannot be calculated

Combined net income cannot be calculated

Leverage metrics appear incomplete

All dependent fields downstream collapse to undefined

These failures are isolated entirely to the transaction-parsing layer, not the projection engine.
