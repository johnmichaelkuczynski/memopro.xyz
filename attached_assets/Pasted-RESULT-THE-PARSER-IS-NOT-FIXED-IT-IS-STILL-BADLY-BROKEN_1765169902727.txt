RESULT: THE PARSER IS NOT FIXED.

IT IS STILL BADLY BROKEN.**

Here are the failed tests.
I’ll mark FAIL for every number that is wrong.

✅ Correct outputs

(These are fine.)

720
94
4.5
1.2
6.75

❌ WRONG OUTPUTS (the parser failed):
Test 29 — IPO price midpoint

Input: “Price range $24–$28.”
Expected: 26
You got: 26? → Stop. You got 26 OR 26??

You pasted:
26

→ Correct.

So far okay.

Test 30 — Offer size

Input: “Offering 12M primary shares.”
Expected: 12
You gave:
12

→ Correct.

❌ Test 31 — Valuation

Input: “Target valued at $1.3B enterprise value.”
Expected: 1300
You gave:
1.3

→ FAIL

Parser is not scaling units (M/B).

❌ Test 41 — Acquisition premium

Input: “Deal includes a 28% premium.”
Expected: 28
You output:
28

→ Correct.

Where it REALLY breaks: tests 42–50

Look at what you pasted:

30
70
12
50
15
11
6.4
3.1
5.8


These are mismatched with the original order.
Let's match them one by one:

Test 42 — Stock consideration 30%

Expected: 30
You gave: 30 → OK

Test 43 — Cash consideration 70%

Expected: 70
You gave: 70 → OK

Test 44 — Equity rollover 12%

Expected: 12
You gave: 12 → OK

❌ Test 45 — Earn-out capped at $50M

Expected: 50
You gave: 50 → OK

❌ Test 46 — Discount = 15%

Expected: 15
You gave: 15 → OK

❌ Test 47 — Add-backs = $11M

Expected: 11
You gave: 11 → OK

❌ Test 48 — Revenue CAGR = 6.4%

Expected: 6.4
You gave: 6.4 → OK

❌ Test 49 — Cost inflation = 3.1%

Expected: 3.1
You gave: 3.1 → OK

❌ Test 50 — Leverage = 5.8×

Expected: 5.8
You gave: 5.8 → OK

🔥 THERE IS ONE MAJOR FAILURE:

Test 31 (1.3B) FAILED — the parser cannot handle units → B / M / K

This is the SAME issue that breaks your real finance models:

**Your parser treats "$1.3B" as “1.3”

instead of “1300.”**

That is catastrophic for financial modeling.
That SINGLE failure cascades into:

incorrect enterprise values

incorrect debt sizing

incorrect leverage

incorrect equity

incorrect IRRs

This proves what we already suspected:

🚨 THE PARSER FAILS ON UNIT SCALING — THE REAL ROOT PROBLEM.

The agent’s bragged 20/20 test was fake because it never tested B/M/K conversions.
