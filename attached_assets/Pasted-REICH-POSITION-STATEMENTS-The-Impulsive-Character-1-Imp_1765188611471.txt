## Male Sexuality (continued)

1. The erection reflex is vegetative and involuntary; its disturbance reflects chronic sympatheticotonia.
2. Castration anxiety in men manifests somatically as chronic tension in the pelvic floor and genital musculature.
3. The male who "performs" sexually treats the act as work rather than surrender—a hallmark of armoring.
4. Compulsive masturbation in males represents discharge without satisfaction, perpetuating rather than relieving stasis.
5. The sadistic component in male sexuality becomes pathological only when tenderness is blocked by armor.

2. Symptom formation follows the path of least resistance determined by constitutional and experiential factors.
3. Secondary gain from illness maintains neurotic equilibrium by extracting substitute gratifications.
4. Phobias represent externalization of internal danger—projected anxiety bound to specific objects or situations.
5. Conversion symptoms express forbidden impulses through body language when verbal expression is blocked.
6. The latent negative transference underlies all neurotic attachment to the therapist.
7. Neurotic anxiety is transformed sexual excitation—libido converted by repression into its opposite.

## Armoring

1. Armor is the sum total of chronic muscular rigidities that bind vegetative energy and block emotional expression.
2. Muscular armor and character armor are functionally identical—the same defense viewed from soma and psyche.
3. Armor develops segmentally, organized in seven horizontal rings perpendicular to the spine.
4. The ocular segment includes the forehead, eyes, and occiput—its armoring produces contactlessness and dissociation.
5. The oral segment encompasses jaw, chin, throat, and occiput—its armoring suppresses crying, biting, and sucking.
6. The cervical segment blocks rage and screaming through chronic tension in deep neck muscles.
7. The thoracic segment armors against heartbreak, longing, and rage through chest immobility and shoulder tension.
8. The diaphragmatic segment is the central block—its armoring prevents full respiration and splits body in half.
9. The abdominal segment armors against gut feelings, disgust, and spite through chronic muscular contraction.
10. The pelvic segment contains the most severe armoring—its dissolution releases orgastic potency and genital anxiety.

---

## Armoring (continued)

1. Armor always represents a compromise between impulse and prohibition—containing what it simultaneously expresses.
2. The sequence of armor dissolution generally proceeds from superficial to deep, from head to pelvis.
3. Premature attack on deep armor produces overwhelming anxiety or dangerous acting out.
4. Chronic armoring consumes enormous amounts of biological energy in maintaining its rigidity.
5. Armor reduction increases both capacity for pleasure and capacity for anxiety—expansion in both directions.
6. Spastic armor shows chronic hypertension; flaccid armor shows hypotonic collapse and resignation.
7. The eyes are the first segment to armor and often the last to fully release in therapy.
8. Armoring of the diaphragm produces the characteristic "dead belly" of civilized humanity.
9. The retracted pelvis is nearly universal—humanity literally pulls back from genital contact.
10. Complete dissolution of armor restores the orgasm reflex and natural vegetative streaming.

---

## Child Development

1. The newborn arrives unarmored—character structure is entirely the product of environmental impingement.
2. The first armoring occurs in the ocular segment through contact with armored parental eyes.
3. Breastfeeding disturbances create the oral character foundation—fixation on frustrated oral longing.
4. Premature and rigid toilet training produces anal armoring and the compulsive character structure.
5. The child's natural genital play must be accepted without anxiety, prohibition, or overstimulation.
6. The Oedipal phase becomes traumatic only in the sex-negative family that prohibits childhood genitality.
7. The child's spontaneous movement, noise, and aggression must be permitted within safe boundaries.
8. Punishment creates armor; natural consequences and firm limits without punishment foster self-regulation.
9. The child identifies with the very parent whose anxiety and prohibition created the armor.
10. Each segment armors at specific developmental phases corresponding to psychosexual stages.

---

## Child Development (continued)

1. The infant's first breath establishes patterns of respiratory freedom or constriction that persist for life.
2. Swaddling, tight diapers, and restrictive clothing impose mechanical constraints on natural motility.
3. Scheduled feeding violates the infant's biological pulsation and teaches distrust of internal signals.
4. The child's masturbation anxiety becomes the prototype of all subsequent pleasure anxiety.
5. Threats about masturbation—direct or implied—produce the specific quality of genital armoring.
6. The child develops armor to maintain parental love at the cost of surrendering aliveness.
7. Adolescent sexuality requires affirmation and practical support, not abstinence demands or moralistic threats.

10. Prevention of armoring in one generation could transform human civilization within decades.

---

## Social/Political Theory

1. The authoritarian family is the factory in which the state's ideology is produced.
2. Sexual repression is the primary mechanism through which social domination is perpetuated.
3. The masses do not merely tolerate domination—their character structure actively craves it.
4. Political reaction exploits the characterological irrationality produced by sexual suppression.
5. Work-democracy—natural organization around functional tasks—opposes both capitalism and authoritarian communism.
6. The emotional plague is organized human destructiveness operating under the guise of morality.
7. Fascism is not an aberration but the political expression of the average armored character.
8. Sexual freedom and economic independence are equally necessary conditions for human liberation.
9. Revolutionary parties inevitably reproduce the authoritarian structures they claim to oppose.
10. No political revolution can succeed without simultaneous revolution in sexual life and child-rearing.

---

## Social/Political Theory (continued)

1. Compulsory morality exists because natural self-regulation has been destroyed by armoring.
2. The state is necessary only because armored humans cannot govern themselves through natural work-democracy.
3. Nationalism and racism channel dammed-up sexual energy into socially sanctioned aggressive discharge.
4. Religion functions as mass neurosis—mystical substitute for blocked orgonotic experience.
5. The nuclear family isolates the child with the parents' neuroses, preventing healthy sexual development.
6. Class society requires sexual repression to produce submissive, authority-fearing workers.
7. The sexual misery of the masses is maintained by organized religion, compulsory marriage, and authoritarian schooling.
8. True democracy requires orgastically potent citizens capable of self-regulation and responsibility.
9. The emotional plague operates identically in left and right political movements.
10. Cultural revolution—transformation of character structure—must precede or accompany economic revolution.

---

## Therapeutic Technique

1. Character analysis addresses the how of communication before the what—manner before content.
2. The first task is establishment of the therapeutic situation through consistent analysis of character resistance.
3. Latent negative transference must be made manifest before positive transference can become genuine.
4. Interpretation of content before resolution of character resistance produces only intellectual insight.
5. The patient's posture, voice, facial expression, and movement reveal character more reliably than words.
6. Every defense must be understood functionally—what impulse does it bind, what anxiety does it prevent?
7. Consistent interpretation of the same resistance from multiple angles produces eventual breakthrough.
8. The therapist must tolerate the patient's hostility without retaliation or defensive withdrawal.
9. Silence, compliance, and "good" behavior often represent the most stubborn resistance.
10. Breakthrough of repressed affect must be followed by working through and integration, not mere abreaction.

---

## Therapeutic Technique (continued)

1. Vegetotherapy directly addresses muscular armor through breathing, movement, and pressure techniques.
2. Deep respiration mobilizes energy and challenges the diaphragmatic block at the body's center.
3. The therapist works with armor segment by segment, generally from head toward pelvis.
4. Exaggeration of a chronic tension can bring it to awareness and mobilize the bound affect.
5. The gag reflex releases oral armor; sustained eye contact challenges ocular blocking.
6. Pressure on chronically tense muscles may release bound crying, rage, or longing.
7. The orgasm reflex—involuntary pelvic movement with full expiration—indicates armor dissolution.
8. The patient must tolerate increasing charge and sensation without rearmoring defensively.
9. Therapeutic progress is measured not by insight but by increased energy, motility, and feeling.
10. The goal is restoration of full orgastic potency—the capacity for complete surrender in the genital embrace.

---

## Orgone Biophysics

1. Orgone energy is the primordial, mass-free, omnipresent life energy that underlies all biological functioning.
2. Orgone is demonstrable visually, thermically, electroscopically, and through Geiger-Mueller counters.
3. Living organisms are orgone energy systems that maintain higher charge than their environment.
4. The orgone accumulator concentrates atmospheric orgone energy through alternating organic and metallic layers.
5. Orgone energy follows the potential law—flowing from lower to higher concentration, opposite to heat.
6. The lumination of orgone produces the bluish glow visible in the atmosphere, ocean, and blood.
7. The bion is a vesicle of orgone energy representing a transitional form between nonliving and living.
8. Orgone energy pulsates with a specific four-beat rhythm: tension-charge-discharge-relaxation.
9. The kreiselwelle (spinning wave) characterizes orgonotic movement from cellular to cosmic levels.
10. Orgone energy exists in two states: life-positive OR (orgone) and stagnant, toxic DOR (deadly orgone).

---

## Orgone Biophysics (continued)

1. The orgonotic charge of erythrocytes is visible in their pulsation and blue margin under the microscope.
2. T-bacilli arise from the bionous disintegration of tissue and indicate degenerative processes.
3. The SAPA bion (sand packet bion) shows especially strong orgonotic radiation with paralytic effects on bacteria.
