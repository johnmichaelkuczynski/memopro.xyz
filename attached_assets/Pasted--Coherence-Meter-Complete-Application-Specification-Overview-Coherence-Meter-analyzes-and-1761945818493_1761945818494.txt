# Coherence Meter: Complete Application Specification

## Overview

Coherence Meter analyzes and improves text coherence across multiple dimensions. It evaluates whether text holds together at different levels (logical, thematic, instructional, etc.) and provides both diagnostic reports and rewrites that maximize the selected type of coherence.

**IMPORTANT PLACEMENT:** This function should be positioned ABOVE "GPT Bypass Humanizer" and BELOW "Text Model Validator" in the application interface.

---

## Core Concept

Coherence exists at multiple levels, from basic logical consistency to sophisticated thematic unity. Different text types require different kinds of coherence:
- Academic arguments need logical cohesiveness
- Fiction needs thematic/psychological coherence
- Management communications need instructional coherence
- Marketing/coaching content needs motivational coherence
- Scientific writing needs explanatory coherence that aligns with natural law

This tool identifies which type of coherence a text needs (or lets the user specify), evaluates how well the text achieves it, and provides a rewrite that maximizes that coherence type.

---

## The Seven Coherence Types

### Type 1: Logical Consistency (Non-Contradiction)
**Definition:** Text contains no direct logical contradictions. Statements don't contradict each other.

**When to use:**
- Most basic level of coherence
- Foundation for all other types
- Minimum requirement for any serious writing

**Example of failure:**
```
The ball is red. The ball is blue. The ball has no color.
```

**What the tool checks:**
- Direct contradictions (X and not-X)
- Incompatible claims
- Mutually exclusive statements presented as simultaneously true

---

### Type 2: Logical Cohesiveness (Argumentative Structure)
**Definition:** Claims don't just avoid contradiction—they actively support each other in a directed way. Each statement builds on or follows from previous statements.

**When to use:**
- Philosophy papers
- Legal arguments
- Academic essays
- Proofs
- Policy documents

**Example of failure:**
```
Democracy is the best form of government. Apples contain vitamin C. 
Therefore, we should increase military spending.
```
(No contradiction, but claims don't support each other)

**Example of success:**
```
According to the computational theory of mind, to think is to compute. But what 
is meant by 'compute'? The generally given answer: computing is symbol manipulation 
driven exclusively by formal properties. However, 'formal' is ambiguous between 
syntactic and morphological senses. CTM fails on each disambiguation. Once we 
register this ambiguity, arguments for CTM cease to be compelling.
```
(Each claim builds on the previous; the argument has directed structure)

**What the tool checks:**
- Premise-conclusion relationships
- Whether intermediate steps are provided
- Whether evidence supports claims
- Whether the logical structure is valid
- Whether there are gaps in reasoning

---

### Type 3: Scientific/Explanatory Coherence
**Definition:** Explanations align with natural law and known mechanisms. The account could plausibly be true given how the world actually works.

**When to use:**
- Scientific writing
- Technical documentation
- Investigative journalism
- Medical/health content
- Any causal explanation

**Example of failure:**
```
Quantum entanglement allows particles to communicate faster than light. This proves 
consciousness creates reality because observers affect quantum states. Therefore, 
positive thinking can heal cancer by collapsing the wave function in your favor.
```

**What's wrong:**
- Entanglement does NOT allow FTL communication
- Observer effect ≠ consciousness
- No mechanism linking thoughts to tumor biology
- Ignores decoherence at biological scales

**Example of success:**
```
Quantum entanglement creates correlations between particles but does not allow 
faster-than-light communication. While measurements require interactions, these 
need not involve consciousness—any physical interaction suffices. At macroscopic 
biological scales, quantum effects are negligible due to thermal decoherence. 
Mental states can affect health through stress reduction and immune function via 
well-understood neuroendocrine pathways.
```

**What the tool checks:**
- Violations of physical laws
- Implausible causal mechanisms
- Missing explanatory steps
- Contradiction with established science
- Appropriate scope (quantum effects at macro scale = red flag)

---

### Type 4: Thematic/Psychological Cohesiveness
**Definition:** Mood, imagery, emotional trajectory, and psychological feel maintain consistency and flow naturally. The "texture" of the writing holds together.

**When to use:**
- Fiction
- Memoir
- Personal essays
- Creative nonfiction
- Literary journalism

**Example of failure:**
```
I came home from the funeral, devastated by my loss. The sun was shining brightly! 
I decided to reorganize my tax documents. My heart felt like it would never heal. 
I wondered what to have for lunch—maybe tacos?
```

**What's wrong:**
- Emotional tone whipsaws (devastation → cheerful → mundane → grief → casual)
- Imagery doesn't support mood (bright sun during grief without acknowledging contrast)
- No psychological plausibility in the sequence

**Example of success:**
```
I came home from college. It was raining—not significant in itself, I know, but 
it certainly fit my mood. My father was home; I heard the familiar tinkling of ice 
in his tumbler; I knew that the abuse would start just a second later.
```

**What works:**
- Weather mirrors internal state
- Sensory details (tinkling ice) build dread
- Past experience informs present emotion
- Psychological progression is believable

**What the tool checks:**
- Consistency of emotional tone
- Whether imagery supports mood
- Psychological plausibility of reactions
- Flow of emotional trajectory
- Whether shifts are motivated or jarring

---

### Type 5: Instructional Coherence
**Definition:** Sends a consistent, actionable message. The reader knows exactly what they are supposed to do. No contradictory directives.

**When to use:**
- Management communications
- How-to guides
- Standard operating procedures
- Training materials
- User manuals

**Example of failure:**
```
To increase sales, focus on customer relationships. Make sure to close deals quickly. 
Spend time understanding client needs. Don't waste time on prospects who aren't 
ready to buy. Build long-term partnerships. Hit your monthly quota no matter what.
```

**What's wrong:**
- "Build relationships" vs "Close quickly" (quality vs speed)
- "Understand needs" vs "Don't waste time" (depth vs efficiency)
- "Long-term partnerships" vs "Hit quota no matter what" (sustainability vs pressure)
- Reader doesn't know which directive to prioritize

**Example of success:**
```
To increase sales, prioritize building genuine customer relationships. Take time to 
understand each client's specific needs, even if it means longer sales cycles. Focus 
on prospects who are ready to engage meaningfully rather than chasing quick wins. 
Cultivate long-term partnerships that will generate sustainable revenue. Your quota 
should be met through quality relationships, not rushed closings.
```

**What works:**
- Single consistent strategy (relationship-building)
- All directives support the same approach
- Clear prioritization
- No contradictory guidance

**What the tool checks:**
- Contradictory instructions
- Unclear priorities
- Ambiguous action items
- Whether directives support or undermine each other
- Whether reader can extract clear action plan

---

### Type 6: Motivational Coherence
**Definition:** User knows how they are supposed to feel. Emotional direction is clear and maintained throughout. Inspires consistent psychological state.

**When to use:**
- Self-help content
- Marketing copy
- Coaching materials
- Motivational speeches
- Team pep talks

**Example of failure:**
```
You can achieve anything you set your mind to! But be realistic about your limitations. 
Dream big and take massive action! Remember that most people fail, so manage your 
expectations. You are unstoppable! Just don't get your hopes up too high.
```

**What's wrong:**
- Inspirational immediately undercut by caution
- Empowerment mixed with defeatism
- Net effect: DEMOTIVATING
- Reader feels confused and deflated

**Tony Robbins Test:** Would Tony Robbins say this? Does it pump you up consistently or confuse your emotional state?

**Example of success:**
```
You can achieve anything you commit to with consistent, focused action. Yes, the path 
will have obstacles—that's how you know you're doing something significant. Most people 
quit when it gets hard, but you're not most people. You have everything you need to 
succeed. Dream big, take massive action, and keep pushing when others stop. You are 
unstoppable.
```

**What works:**
- Consistent empowerment message
- Obstacles reframed as validation, not threats
- Sustained emotional energy
- Reader knows how to feel: FIRED UP

**What the tool checks:**
- Emotional consistency
- Whether caution undermines inspiration
- Defeatist language mixed with empowerment
- Net emotional effect
- Whether reader has clear emotional direction

---

### Type 7: Auto-Detect
**Definition:** System analyzes the text and determines which type(s) of coherence it's attempting to achieve, then routes to appropriate analysis.

**How it works:**
The tool examines:
- Discourse markers (therefore, however, because = logical)
- Domain vocabulary (scientific terms = explanatory)
- Imperative verbs (do this, avoid that = instructional)
- Emotional language (you can, unstoppable = motivational)
- Narrative/sensory details (imagery, mood = thematic)

Then selects the most appropriate coherence type(s) and explains the choice.

COHERENCE ANALYSIS

Coherence Type Analyzed: Scientific/Explanatory
Overall Score: 1/10  ✗ FAIL - MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS OF NATURAL LAW

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DETAILED REPORT:

Violations of Physical Laws:

Line 1: "communicate faster than light"
  ✗ INCORRECT: Entanglement creates correlations but does NOT allow FTL communication
  → No information can be transmitted via entanglement alone
  → This violates special relativity

Line 2: "observers affect quantum states"  
  ⚠ MISLEADING: Observer effect does not require consciousness
  → ANY physical interaction counts as "measurement"
  → Consciousness is not necessary for wave function collapse

Line 2: "consciousness creates reality"
  ✗ UNSUPPORTED: No established mechanism linking consciousness to physical reality
  → Interpretation of quantum mechanics, not empirical fact
  → Many interpretations (e.g., many-worlds) don't require this

Line 3: "positive thinking can heal cancer"
  ✗ IMPLAUSIBLE: No mechanism for thoughts to affect tumor biology via quantum effects
  → Biological systems are "warm, wet, and noisy" - quantum decoherence is immediate
  → Quantum effects are negligible at cellular/tissue scales

Explanatory Gaps:
• Missing: How does consciousness interface with quantum states?
• Missing: How do quantum effects persist in biological systems?
• Missing: What is the mechanism from thoughts → wave function → tumor cells?

Impact Assessment:
This Explanation COULD NOT Be True Given Known Physics
• Violates special relativity (FTL communication)
• Misunderstands observer effect (consciousness not required)
• Ignores decoherence (quantum effects don't scale to biology)
• No plausible causal pathway from thoughts to cellular processes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REWRITTEN VERSION (Maximized for Scientific Coherence):

Quantum entanglement creates correlations between particles, but does not allow 
faster-than-light communication or information transfer. While quantum measurements 
require interactions that can be called "observation," this does not require 
consciousness—any physical interaction with the system suffices. At the macroscopic 
scale of human biology, quantum effects are negligible due to thermal decoherence, 
which occurs almost instantaneously in warm, wet environments. Mental states can 
affect health through stress reduction and immune function, but this occurs via 
well-understood neuroendocrine pathways involving cortisol, inflammatory markers, 
and immune cell activity—not through quantum mechanical processes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHANGES MADE:

• Corrected entanglement description (correlations, not FTL communication)
• Clarified observer effect doesn't require consciousness
• Removed unsupported "consciousness creates reality" claim
• Explained why quantum effects don't apply at biological scales (decoherence)
• Provided actual mechanism for mind-body health connection (neuroendocrine)
• Result: Scientifically accurate explanation that respects physical laws

### Sample 4: Logical Cohesiveness

**Input:**
```
According to the computational theory of mind, to think is to compute. But what is 
meant by 'compute'? The generally given answer: computing is symbol manipulation 
driven exclusively by formal properties. However, 'formal' is ambiguous between 
syntactic and morphological senses. CTM fails on each disambiguation. Once we 
register this ambiguity, arguments for CTM cease to be compelling.
```

**Output:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COHERENCE ANALYSIS

Coherence Type Analyzed: Logical Cohesiveness  
Overall Score: 8/10  ✓ STRONG - WELL-STRUCTURED ARGUMENT

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DETAILED REPORT:

Argument Structure: COHERENT

Premise 1: CTM claims thinking = computing
Premise 2: Computing = symbol manipulation via formal properties
Key Move: 'Formal' is ambiguous (syntactic vs morphological)
Claim: CTM fails on both interpretations
Conclusion: Arguments for CTM lose force once ambiguity is recognized

Logical Flow: STRONG
✓ Each claim builds on the previous
✓ Question is asked then answered
✓ Critical term ('formal') is identified and analyzed
✓ Conclusion follows from the disambiguation

Minor Areas for Enhancement:
• Line 5: "CTM fails on each disambiguation" - could use brief explanation of WHY
• Conclusion would be strengthened by briefly stating what the failure means

Impact Assessment:
This is a well-constructed philosophical argument with:
• Clear dialectical structure
• Proper identification of key term
• Systematic analysis
• Conclusion that follows from analysis

The argument successfully builds from definition to critique in logical steps.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REWRITTEN VERSION (Maximized for Logical Cohesiveness):

According to the computational theory of mind (CTM), to think is to compute. But what 
is meant by 'compute'? The generally given answer: computing is symbol manipulation 
driven exclusively by formal properties. However, 'formal' is ambiguous—it can refer 
to form in either the syntactic sense or the morphological sense. CTM fails on each 
disambiguation: if 'formal' means syntactic, then non-symbolic processes are excluded 
without justification; if 'formal' means morphological, then the distinction between 
computation and mere causal process collapses. Once we register this ambiguity, 
arguments for CTM cease to be compelling, as the theory's core claim depends on an 
equivocation.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHANGES MADE:

• Added brief explanation of why CTM fails on each disambiguation
• Made the failure conditions explicit (exclusion without justification / collapsed distinction)
• Strengthened conclusion by identifying the logical error (equivocation)
• Result: Even more explicit logical structure with no inferential gaps

**Input:**
```
I came home from the funeral, devastated by my loss. The sun was shining brightly!

COHERENCE ANALYSIS

Coherence Type Analyzed: Thematic/Psychological
Overall Score: 3/10  ✗ FAIL - EMOTIONAL WHIPLASH

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DETAILED REPORT:

Emotional Trajectory: INCOHERENT

Line 1: "devastated by my loss" → Deep grief [APPROPRIATE]
Line 2: "The sun was shining brightly!" → Cheerful imagery [JARRING]
  • No acknowledgment of contrast between internal/external state
  • Exclamation point suggests enthusiasm (inappropriate for grief)

Line 3: "reorganize my tax documents" → Mundane task [PSYCHOLOGICALLY IMPLAUSIBLE]
  • People in acute grief don't typically think about bureaucratic tasks
  • No transition from devastating loss to administrative concerns

Line 4: "My heart felt like it would never heal" → Return to grief [DISCONNECTED]
  • Emotional intensity returns without connection to tax documents

Line 5: "wondered what to have for lunch—maybe tacos?" → Casual/cheerful [WHIPLASH]
  • From "never heal" to "tacos?" with no transition
  • Tone is inappropriately light given context

Thematic Issues:
• Imagery doesn't support emotional state (bright sun during grief)
• Psychological progression is implausible (grief → taxes → grief → tacos)
• No emotional through-line connecting moments
• Reader cannot follow the narrator's psychological state

Impact Assessment:
The text feels disjointed and emotionally confusing. The rapid shifts between 
devastation, cheerfulness, mundane tasks, and grief prevent the reader from 
engaging with the narrator's experience. The psychological progression doesn't 
ring true to how people actually process grief.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REWRITTEN VERSION (Maximized for Thematic/Psychological Coherence):

I came home from the funeral, devastated by my loss. The sun was shining—bright, 
indifferent, almost mocking in its cheerfulness. I moved through the house like a 
ghost, straightening things that didn't need straightening, picking up objects and 
putting them down again without purpose. My heart felt like it would never heal. 
I stood in the kitchen for a long time, staring at nothing, unable to remember what 
I'd come there for.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CHANGES MADE:

• Reframed bright sun as contrast to internal state (now thematically coherent)
• Replaced "tax documents" with aimless tidying (psychologically plausible for grief)
• Removed exclamation point (tone now matches mood)
• Changed "tacos?" to forgetting purpose (authentic grief behavior)
• Added details that support emotional state (ghost-like movement, staring at nothing)
• Result: Sustained mood, psychologically believable, thematically unified

1. Overall coherence score (1-10) with assessment (PASS/WEAK/FAIL)
2. Detailed analysis of coherence issues with specific line numbers
3. Impact assessment: How do these issues affect the text?

Format your response as:
- Clear section headers
- Specific examples with line references
- Severity indicators (✓ ⚠ ✗)
```

### Template for Rewrite Phase:
```
You are a coherence maximizer. Your task is to rewrite text to maximize [COHERENCE_TYPE] coherence.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
{user_text}

COHERENCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
{analysis_results}

Generate a rewritten version that:
1. Maintains the core content/message
2. Resolves all identified coherence issues
3. Maximizes [COHERENCE_TYPE] coherence

Then explain:
- What specific changes were made
- Why each change improves coherence
- How the rewrite addresses the original issues

The rewrite should be approximately the same length as the original.
```

### Template for Auto-Detect:
```
You are a text classifier for coherence analysis.

TEXT:
{user_text}

Analyze this text and determine which type(s) of coherence it is attempting to achieve:
- Logical Consistency
- Logical Cohesiveness  
- Scientific/Explanatory
- Thematic/Psychological
- Instructional
- Motivational

Consider:
- Discourse markers and connectives
- Domain-specific vocabulary
- Sentence types (declarative, imperative, etc.)
- Emotional language
- Argumentative structure
- Narrative elements

Provide:
1. Primary coherence type
2. Secondary type (if applicable)
3. Reasoning for your classification
4. Confidence level (high/medium/low)

Then proceed to analyze the text for the identified coherence type(s).
```

## Success Criteria

The Coherence Meter successfully analyzes text when it:

1. **Accurately identifies coherence failures** at the selected level
2. **Provides specific, actionable feedback** with line numbers and examples
3. **Generates rewrites that genuinely improve coherence** without losing content
4. **Explains changes clearly** so users understand what was improved
5. **Matches intuitive human judgment** about what "holds together"

The tool fails when it:
- Marks coherent text as incoherent
- Misidentifies the type of coherence needed
- Generates rewrites that lose important content
- Provides vague feedback without specific examples
- Creates rewrites that are technically correct but stilted/unnatural

## Integration Requirements

**CRITICAL: This function must be placed in the interface:**
- **ABOVE:** "GPT Bypass Humanizer"
- **BELOW:** "Text Model Validator"

The vertical ordering should be:
1. Text Model Validator
2. **Coherence Meter** ← NEW FUNCTION
3. GPT Bypass Humanizer

## Error Handling

### Text Too Long:
```
⚠ Text exceeds 500-word limit. Please shorten your text or contact us about 
longer text analysis options.

Current length: [X] words
Maximum: 500 words
```

### No Text Provided:
```
⚠ Please enter text to analyze.
```

### Ambiguous Coherence Type (Auto-Detect):
```
⚠ This text contains elements of multiple coherence types:
  - Instructional (40% confidence)
  - Motivational (35% confidence)

Recommendation: Select coherence type manually or clarify the text's purpose.
```

### Cannot Improve Further:
```
✓ This text already achieves strong [COHERENCE_TYPE] coherence (Score: 9/10).

Only minor improvements possible. No rewrite generated.
```
