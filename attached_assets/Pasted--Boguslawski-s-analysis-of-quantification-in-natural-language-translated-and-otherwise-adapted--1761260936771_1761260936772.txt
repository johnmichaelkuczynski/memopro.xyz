Anti-Fregean analyses of quantification
ABSTRACT
In a recent paper, Andrzej Boguslawski has put forth some powerful reasons to reject some
orthodoxies concerning the literal meanings of ‘‘some’’, ‘‘all’’, and other quantifier.
Boguslawski’s paper is written for linguists, not for philosophers of language. For that
reason, philosophers of language are unlikely to understand it or, therefore, to see the
relevance to their own work of Boguslawski’s points. The present paper can be thought of
as a ‘‘translation’’ of Boguslawski’s paper. Originally written in the language of linguistics,
Boguslawski’s paper is hereby being translated into the language of the philosophy of
language. That said, the translation is not a strict one. The present author has taken the
liberty of extending and otherwise modifying some of Boguslawski’s arguments and, to a
lesser extent, of doing the same with some of his key contentions.

In this paper, quotation marks are to be taken as quasi-quotation marks whenever it is appropriate to do so. When using Word, or any other standard
writing software (that I know of), the only way to construct quasi-quotation marks is by means ofad hocmethods; and quasi-quotes thus formed don’t
survive conversion into non-word (e.g. PDF) format.
2
Two points must be made clear at the outset. First, each of these contentions concerns theliteral meaningsof sentences with which they are concerned;
they concern,notwhat is conveyed by suggestion (by way of ‘‘implicature’’), but only what issemantically encoded in(or, in other words,literally meant by)
the sentences in question. So, for example, Point #4 is not to the effect that, if six elephants can dance, an utterance of ‘‘five elephants can dance’’ is, while
being technically correct, nonethelessmisleadingorinsufficiently informativeor otherwise defective in some pragmatic (as opposed to semantic) way. Point
#4 is to the effect that, if six elephants can dance, an utterance of ‘‘five elephants can dance’’ is, at the level of literal meaning (semantics), incorrect and, in
that respect, in the same category as an utterance of ‘‘1 + 1 = 3’’ or of ‘‘Sweden is to the south of France.’’ The same thingmutatis mutandisholds of each of the
other just-stated contentions.
Second, it’s deeply important in this paper to bear in mind the distinction between sentences, on the one hand, and propositions, on the other. (By a
proposition, I mean what is affirmed by an utterance of an indicative sentence
2
, by an utterance of, e.g. ‘‘Jefferson was a great statesman.’’ Obviously what
such an utterance affirms is distinct from the utterance used to affirm it and also from the sentence-type of which that utterance is an instance.) The logical
properties of propositions aren’t always in lockstep with those of the sentences (or sentence-tokens
2
) that express them. Here’s an example. According to (a
version of) a view first put forth by Strawson and now held by many mainstream semanticists, the semantic rule for ‘‘that phi has psi’’ is given by the
following rule:
(STR) If, in the context of utterance, O is uniquely a salient phi, then an utterance U in that context of ‘‘that phi is psi’’ has for its literal meaning a
proposition P that is true exactly if O has psi.

Point #2:‘‘Some phi is a psi’’ merelypresupposesthat there is at least one phi. It does not (see Point #1)sayit. (By contrast,
‘‘there exists at least one phi and, moreover, at least one phi is also a psi’’ actuallysaysit.)
Point #3:The sentence ‘‘all phi’s are psi’s’’ isincompatiblewith the sentence ‘‘some phi’s are psi’s.’’ So the former entails the
negationof the latter anda fortioriisn’t compatible with the latter.
Point #4:‘‘Five elephants can dance’’ is to the effect that exactly five elephants can dance. So that sentence is false, and not
merely misleading, if six elephants can dance. For any numeral n, ‘‘n phi’s are psi’s’’ is to the effect that exactly n
phi’s are psi’s.
Point #5(an immediate consequence of Point #4): ‘‘Ten elephants can dance’’ is incompatible with the sentence ‘‘five
elephants can dance.’’ In general, if m6¼n, ‘‘m phi’s are psi’s’’ is incompatible with ‘‘n phi’s are psi’s.’’
Most contemporary logicians and philosophers either assume, or explicitly state, that each of #1–#5 is false, and much of
what they say crumbles unless they’re right about this.
2. Why Point #1 is correct
But #1–#5 are correct. Right now let’s focus on #1.
Consider the following two sentences:
1.‘‘There is at least one diamond on the table, and at least one such diamond is extremely valuable.’’
2.‘‘Some of the diamonds on the table are extremely valuable.’’
For argument’s sake, assume that there are several diamonds on the table in question and that many of them, if not all, are
extremely valuable.
Do 1 and 2 have the same meaning? No. 1 explicitly says, among other things, that there is at least one diamond on the
table. But 2 doesn’tsaythis; itpresupposesit. If it is in question whether there are any diamonds on the table, an utterance of 1
wouldbe appropriate, whereas an utterance of 2 wouldnotbe appropriate. Why is it inappropriate to utter 2 under such
circumstance? Because, clearly, such an utterance presupposes an answer to a question that, given such circumstances, has
yet to be answered. Why is it appropriate to utter 1 under such circumstance? Because, clearly, such an utterancegivesan
answer to a question that, given such circumstances, has yet to be answered. So, contrary to what is generally held, 2, unlike
1, isnotan existence-claim.
2.1. A similar argument
If asked ‘‘do any felines exist?’’, one is responding in a completely non-defective manner if one says:
(A)‘‘Yes. There exists at least one feline; moreover, at least one feline is ferocious.’’
But oneisresponding in a defective manner if one instead says:
(B)‘‘some felines are ferocious.’’
So if STR is right, then, when I point to person x, thereby making him contextually salient, and I then say ‘‘that guy is an economist’’, the proposition
encoded in my utterance is true exactly if x is an economist.Butmy utterance itself—the linguistic vehicle I am using to affirm the just-described
proposition—has different truth-conditions from that proposition. My utterance is true exactly if:there is, in the relevant context (at the relevant juncture),
exactly one salient individual x; moreover, x is an economist.So, supposing that Smith is the economist at whom I’m pointing, and about whom I’m talking in
saying ‘‘that guy is an economist’’, the proposition literally meant by utterance is true exactly if:
(&)   Smith is an economist,
whereas the utterance I am producing is true exactly if, in the context in question:
(&&)   there is a uniquely salient individual, and any such individual (it doesn’t matter who it is) is an economist.
(& and && are to be taken to be propositions, not sentences or expressions of any other kind.).
& neither entails, nor is entailed by, &&. & could be true even if there were never any circumstances under which Smith were a salient individual, and it
could be false if he were, in the context in question, a salient individual (so long as he wasn’t also an economist); and && could be true even if Smith weren’t
an economist, and it could be true even if Smith were an economist (so long as the individual who, in the relevant context was salientwasan economist—so
long as, for example, Kenneth Arrow happened to be in the place at which I was pointing). The truth-conditions of myutterance—not of the proposition I’m
affirming by means of it, but of my utteranceper se—are given by &&. The truth-conditions myutteranceare fulfilled exactly if && is true. But the
truth-conditions of the proposition I’ve affirmed by means of that utterance are fulfilled exactly if & is true. So supposing that STR is right, given that & neither
entails,norisentailedby,&&,itfollowsthattheinferentialliaisonsofmyutteranceareradicallydifferentfromthoseofthecorrespondingproposition.Andeven
if STR isn’t right, we could easily do whatKaplan (1970)does, which is to invent an expression ‘‘dthat’’, such that the semantic rule for ‘‘dthat’’ is given by STR
(mutatis mutandis). Which, even if STR is not the rule that is actually operative, suffices to show that sentence-logic and proposition-logic are very different
things. This astonishing fact—which, I emphasize, was made clear by Peter Strawson—is responsible for the misunderstandings which I, following Dr.
Boguslawski, am trying to correct in this paper.

Under the circumstances, what is in question is whether there are any felines. B presupposes an answer to that very question;
that’s why it’s inappropriate. A does not presuppose an answer to that question; Aassertsthat there is at least one feline:
unlike B, it doesn’tassumeit. And that’s why, under the circumstances, Aisan appropriate utterance.
Thus, whereas it is (a part of) A’s job to state that there are felines, it is no part of B’s job to do this. This shows, in other
words, that B is an existence-claim, whereas A is not. Points #1 and #2 have thus been established.
Notice also that, if asked ‘‘do any felines exist?’’, one isoverresponding by uttering A, whereas, if asked that same question,
one isunderresponding by uttering B. And if, having been asked that question, one were to utter A, one’s interrogator would
notrespond with puzzlement, whereas one’s interrogatorwouldso respond had one instead uttered B. Why this difference?
Because, whereas B isn’t on point—or, if itison point, it isonlybecause, in the process of interpreting it, the auditor is making
ad hoccorrections to it–Aison point. In other words, whereas B is on pointonlyin so far as the auditor, when interpreting it,
takes it as a stand-in for some other sentence, A is on pointwithoutthe auditor’s having to engage in any such artifices. Why is
it that, setting aside suchad hocmaneuvers on the auditor’s part, A is on point, whereas B is not? Because, in uttering B, one is
presupposing what, given the question, one should be affirming, whereas, in uttering A, one isnotmaking that mistake.
3
2.2. Presupposition vs. assertion
The following story will help clarify how A and B are semantically different. If, while pointing at a certain man, I utter the
sentence:
(MS)‘‘that person is a menace to society’’,
what I amsaying
4
(in other words, the proposition I’m affirming) is not to the same effect as what I’d be saying ifceteris
paribusI were to utter the sentence:
(TE)‘‘there exists a uniquely contextually salient individual x; moreover, x is a menace to society.’’
In uttering TE, I am asserting, not presupposing, that there is such a man. And that’s why, if asked whether there a
contextually salient man, I’d be responding in a non-defective manner by uttering TE. In uttering MS, on the other hand, I am
presupposing, not asserting, that there exists a uniquely contextually salient person x. And that’s why, if asked that same
question, I’d be responding in a defective manner by uttering MS.
Bearing in mind what we just said, let’s revisit sentences A and B. As we saw, A is, whereas B is not, an appropriate
response to the question ‘‘do any felines exist?’’ And the reason, as we said, is that, whereas A is itself an answer to that
question, B assumes a certain answer to it. Hopefully, the points just made in connection with ME and TE reinforce what we
said about A and B and, therefore, about 1 and 2.
2.3. The concept of presupposition and the distinction between sentence-logic vs. proposition-logic
‘‘There must be an error in your reasoning’’, it will be said:
‘‘1 is obviously an existence-claim. You admit this. You also admit that 1 and 2 are equivalent. Given those facts, it surely
follows that the proposition affirmed by 2 is equivalent with one to the effect that there exists at least one apple on the
table and, moreover, that at least one such apple is rotten. And oncethatis granted, it becomes very hard to see how 2
could fail to be an existence-claim. In fact, given that 1 and 2 are equivalent, it becomes unclear what it even means to say
that 2 is not an existence-claim.’’
1 and 2 are indeed equivalent. (In any case, they’re equivalent in the weak sense that the one cannot be true if the other
fails to be true, even though, in circumstances where there is no unique contextually salient man, TE one is false whereas ME
other is without truth-value.) But 1 and 2 aresentences. Sometimes equivalentsentenceshave non-equivalentpropositionsfor
their meanings.
5
This is one of those cases. Once again, it will help to look at TE and MS. The semantic rule for MS is this
6
:
(MSR) If, in a given context C, there is a uniquely contextually salient individual x, then the proposition meant by an
utterance in C of ‘‘that person is a menace to society’’ is identical (or equivalent) with:x is a menace to society.
3
(The contents of this footnote are speculative.) If, having been asked, ‘‘do any felines exist?’’, one uttered B, one’s interrogator might respond with
boredom, since the second conjunct (the part starting with ‘‘moreover’’) isn’t responsive to what was being asked. But that only confirms our point: sofar as
the second conjunct elicits boredom, it’s only because the question that had been asked (‘‘do any felines exist?’’) hadalreadybeen answered in a satisfactory
manner. If, in response to that question, one were to utter B, one’s interrogator would be puzzled. (‘‘Why did he saysome? Didn’t he hear my question? Or is
it so widely known that there are felines that he appropriately thought my question not worth answering, and instead of wasting his time answering a
stupid question, answered a non-stupid, but otherwise similar, question?...’’).
4
At least not ifStrawson (1950)andKaplan (1989a, 1989b)are right. It should be made explicit that, on this matter, the Strawson–Kaplan view is
consistent with the conventional wisdom.
5
This was discovered byStrawson (1950).Kaplan (1989a, 1989b)develops Strawson’s point.
6
Assuming the truth of the conventional wisdom. SeeKaplan (1989a, 1989b), Taylor (1998), and Perry (2001). I’ve defended this view at considerable
length. See Kuczynski (2007, Chapter 1; 2009, Chapter 4).

The semantic rule for TE is this:
(TER) The proposition meant by an utterance, in a given context C, of ‘‘there exists a uniquely contextually salient
individual x; moreover, x is a menace to society’’ is identical (or equivalent) with:there is a unique contextually salient
individual x and, moreover, x is a menace to society.
Thus, supposing that, while pointing at Smith, I utter ME, the proposition I’m thereby affirming is true iff Smith is a
menace to society. That proposition has nothing to do with Smith’s being contextually salient; that proposition would
be true even if Smith weren’t contextually salient. The material relating to contextual salience in the semantic rule for
ME does not itself make it into the proposition meant by a given utterance of that sentence; that material serves the
purpose only ofidentifyingthe person whom such an utterance (when non-abortive) describes as being a menace to
society.
But the proposition I’m affirming in uttering TE—even if, while doing so, I’m pointing at Smith—could be true even if Smith
weren’ta menace to society; and that propositiondoescontain material relating to the concept of contextual salience (for it
saysinter aliathat something x falls under that concept).
At the same time, the semantic rules for MS and TE being what they are, there is no possible circumstance in which an
utterance of the one sentence is true and in which an utterance of the other is false. (By ‘‘no possible circumstance’’, I mean
‘‘no possible circumstancein whichthe semantic rules of the English language are operative.’’) So, even though the
proposition literally meant, in a given set of circumstances, by a given token of ME is not equivalent with the proposition
literally meant, in those very circumstances, by an utterance of TE, there is no possible set of circumstances in which an
utterance of MS isn’t true exactly iff an utterance of TE is true.
7
A consequence of the reasonable presumption that MSR is the semantic rule for MS is that, if produced in
circumstances in which there is no contextually salient individual x, an utterance of MS fails to haveanyproposition
for its meaning and is therefore abortive (i.e. neither true nor false). MSR is to the effect that,givensuch an individual,
a person who utters MS is thereby describing that individual as menace to society; MSR makes no provision
for circumstances in which there is no such individual. It is for that reason that if, under such circumstances, one were
to utter MS, that statement would register, not as false, but as out of place. And it is for that reasonmutatis mutandis
that, were one to utter TS under such circumstances,thatstatement would register as false, and not as out of
place.
8
7
Strictly speaking, the equivalence is not strict, since, if there is contextually salient man, an utterance of the one is false whereas an utterance ofthe
other, embodying as it does a presupposition-failure, is neither true nor false.
8
This raises the question: what is the semantic rule for 2? Until a plausible answer to that question is given, many a reader will be more inclined to look
for errors in our arguments for Points #1–#5, and to accept the Fregean orthodoxies it is the purpose of those arguments to undermine, than to accept those
Points. For this reason, I feel that it’s incumbent on me to try to answer this question. At the same time, we don’t need to know the answer to this to establish
that Points #1–#5 are correct. For this reason, I feel justified in relegating my attempt to answer this question to a footnote. Also, I’d be obscuring the overall
structure of my paper were I to include my attempt to answer this question anywhere other than in a footnote, the reason being that, as we’re about to see,
this question is a hard one and cannot be answered succinctly. In any case, what follows is an outline of an answer to that question. (I will number the
sections composing it as I would had they been included in the paper proper).
2.3.1. MSR as relevantly similar to the semantic rule for 2.If made in a context where it was in question whether there were any diamonds on the
relevant table, an utterance of 2 would register as out of place, as opposed to false, and an utterance of 1 would register as false, as opposed to out place.
Moreover, in such a context, an utterance of 2 would register as being awry in much the way in which, in a context in which it was in question whether there
is a contextually salient individual, an utterance of ME would register as awry. And the way in which, in a context where there were no diamonds on the
table, an utterance of 1 wouldcontrastwith an utterance of 2 seems to coincide with the way in which, in a context where it’s in question whether there is a
contextually salient man, the way an utterance of TE (favorably) contrasts with an utterance of MS.
Taken together, these points suggest that, when trying to identify the semantic rule for 2, we should use MSR, not TSE, as a model. More precisely, the
semantic rule for 2 is such that, if there are no diamonds on the relevant table, an utterance of 2 is neither true nor false—just as the semantic rule for MEis
such that, if there is no contextually salient man, an utterance of ME is neither nor false. These points entail—what we know on independent grounds—that
the semantic rule for 2 isnotgiven by the following:
(SR2#)
The proposition literally meant by an utterance (in a context where there is exactly one salient table) of ‘‘some of the diamonds on the
table are extremely valuable’’ is true just in case:there exists at least one diamond on the relevant table and, moreover, at least one diamond
on that table is extremely valuable.c
And the reason, of course, is that, were SR2# the right rule, an utterance of 2 would be false, not out of place, in a context where it was in question whether
there were any diamonds on the relevant table.
But at this point we must be careful. Given what was just said, it’s tempting to suppose the semantic rule for 2 to be given by (some variant of) the
following:
(SR2*)
Supposing thatx
1
...x
n
are diamonds on the relevant table, an utterance of ‘‘some of the diamonds on the table are extremely valuable’’ has
for its literal meaning a proposition that is true just in case, for somek(1kn),x
k
is extremely valuable.
But SR2* is demonstrably the wrong rule.
8
There is nospecifichuman being x such that, if I say ‘‘some people have good hearts’’, my utterance is correct
only if x has a good heart. Even if I’m wrong as to who it is that has a good heart—even if, when saying ‘‘some people have a good heart’’, I’m thinking of Smith,
whose heart, unbeknownst to me, is blackened by evil—my statement is as long assomebody or other—it doesn’t matter who—is good-hearted. Much the
same holds of 2. Given any specific diamond x, an utterance of 2 could be true even if x were not valuable.A fortiori, given any specific diamondsx
1
...x
n
, such
an utterance could be true even, for no k (1kn),x
k
was extremely valuable. So SR2* isn’t the right rule.
Section 2.3.2. Some relevant preliminary points concerning the word ‘‘set’’.Before we can identify a rule that does not have the defect that we just
saw SR2* to have and that is otherwise consistent with the data, we must make a few points of a general nature about the word ‘‘set’’.

3. Why Point #3 is correct
The orthodoxy
9
these days is that (in a non-empty universe) the sentence:
(SP)‘‘something is a phi’’
is a logical consequence of the sentence:
(EP)‘‘everything is a phi.’’
(From now on, we’ll leave the parenthetical qualification unstated.)
Let SE be the contention that SP entails EP. (Of course, SP is compatible with EP if it entails it.) SE concerns sentences of
ordinary English; it doesn’t concern their artificial analogues. So SE isnotthe principle, which we’ll call ‘‘SEF’’, that
(EPF)‘‘(x)(x has phi).’’
entails
(SPF)‘‘(Ex)(x has phi).’’
10
SEF is trivially correct, given that EPF and SPF arestipulatedto mean, respectively,
(EPF#)given any object x, x has phi
That word is ambiguous, having as it does, both ‘‘extensional’’ and ‘‘non-extensional’’ (or ‘‘intensional’’) interpretations. Suppose that 2 is Jerry’s favorite
number. In that case, when read extensionally, the statement:
(x
1
)   ‘‘x is a member of the smallest set containing Jerry’s favorite number’’
is equivalent with
(x
2
)   ‘‘x = 2.’’
Read non-extensionally, x1 equivalent with:
(x
3
)   ‘‘x is a number and Jerry likes x more than he likes any other number.’’
x
2
doesn’t entail x
3
and x
3
doesn’t entail x
2
.
Logicians and semanticists tend to use the word ‘‘set’’ extensionally. But the laity tendnotto use it that way. Read extensionally, the statement
(x
4
)   ‘‘even though x = 2, x isn’t a member of the smallest set containing Jerry’s favorite number’’
is tautologically false. But, as the word ‘‘set’’ is ordinarily used, x
4
isn’t tautologically false; and even if utterances of it are false today, they’ll be true the
moment Jerry comes to like 3 more than he likes 2. So, as it is ordinarily used, the word ‘‘set’’ is not always to be read extensionally.
There’s no denying that, when x
1
(or, indeed, any one of x
1
-x
4
) is read extensionally, the definite description occurring in it (‘‘the smallest set containing
Jerry’s favorite number’’) picks out a certain entity. This suggests (though it doesn’t prove) that, when x
1
is readintensionally, that expression picks out an
entity of some kind. Supposing this to be correct, let’s refer to that entity as ‘‘the smallest set* containing Jerry’s favorite number.’’ For any property phi, ‘‘the
set* of phi’s’’ refers to that entity, if any there be, picked out by non-extensional occurrences of ‘‘the set of the phi’s.’’ So ‘‘the set* of people’’ picks out some
entity of which I’m currently a member but which will continue to exist after I cease to exist and which could exist even if I didn’t exist.
From now on, any occurrences of the word ‘‘set’’ (no asterisk) will be extensional. So, if 2 is Jerry’s favorite number, then ‘‘x is a member of the smallest
set containing Jerry’s favorite number’’ will be equivalent with ‘‘x = 2.’’
There are some important respects in which sets* differ from sets. First, whereas the membership of any given set (no asterisk) given is modally frozen,
there are sets* whose memberships are not modally frozen. The smallest set* containing Jerry’s favorite number varies from possible world to possible
world. But the corresponding set does not so vary.
Second, whereas the membership any given set is temporally frozen, the same is not true of all sets*. Jerry’s feelings about numbers may change.
Third, whereas there is a sense in which one cannot understand ‘‘...the set of phi’s...’’ unless one knows, for any entity x, whether or not x is a phi, there
is no comparable sense in which one must have such knowledge to understand ‘‘...the set* of phi’s...’’ Given that (when read extensionally) x
1
is equivalent
with x
2
, one cannot know exactly what conditions must obtain for x
1
to be trueunlessone knows that 2 is Jerry’s favorite number. But one doesn’t need such
knowledge to know exactly what must hold if
(x
1
*)   ‘‘x is a member of the smallest set* containing Jerry’s favorite number’’
is to be true.
Section 2.3.3. Our answer.Bearing all of these points in mind, consider the following statement:
(SR
2
)
If there exists a non-empty set* S of diamonds on the relevant table, and there are diamonds on the table that don’t belong to S, then an
utterance of ‘‘some of the diamonds on the table are extremely valuable’’ is true exactly if all of S’s members are extremely valuable.
(If there is no such set*, then such an utterance is neither true nor false.)
I would suggest that SR
2
is the semantic rule for 2.
9
It may be going too far to say that the view about to be described is ‘‘theorthodox view.’’ But, if it is going too far, it’s going to far by only a tiny amount.
For it is, at the very least, an extremely widespread view, and, before reading Dr Boguslawski’s paper, I had yet to read a (post-Fregean) article by a
philosopher of language in which it is contested. In any case, I will refer to the view being disputed as ‘‘the orthodox view.’’ What is thereby lost in accuracy
(which, I believe, is nothing) will made up for in brevity.
10
The ‘‘E’’ is supposed to be backwards. My writing-program doesn’t given one the option of typing the backwards ‘‘E’’ that, in formal logic, representsthe
existential quantifier.

and
(SPF#)there exists at least one thing x such that x has phi.
SE says that SP is a consequence of EP. SE doesn’t say anything about SPF# or EPF#.
3.1. Why Point #3 is correct: a preliminary argument
Is SE correct? No. A story will help make this clear. You go to a costume party. Every single person at the costume party is
wearing a vampire costume. Later, when you are talking with your roommate Smith, who wanted to attend the party but was
unable to, Smith asks you: ‘‘how many people at the party wore vampire costumes?’’ You answer by saying:
(SVC)‘‘some of the people at the party wore vampire costumes.’’
Surely you’ve given the wrong answer. What you should have said is:
(AVC)‘‘allof the people at the party wore vampire costumes.’’
The fact that AVC is, whereas SVC is not, the right answer does not, by itself, prove that SE is false. That fact suggests, in other
words, that Point #3 is correct.
3.2. An objection to an objection to our preliminary argument
It has been argued that SVC is technically correct (i.e. that the proposition that is its literal meaning is correct), even
though, given the circumstances, SVC misleadinglysuggeststhat some people did not wear vampire costumes.
But this position is demonstrably false. Consider the following sentences:
(a
1
)Some cupcakes are yummy.
(a
2
)Only some cupcakes are yummy.
(a
2
*)Onlysomecupcakes are yummy. (The italics indicate that the occurrence of ‘‘some’’ is being emphasized.)
(a
3
)at most some cupcakes are yummy.
It should be noted that a
2
and a
3
are (virtually) synonymous and, in addition, that each of a
1
–a
3
is perfectly grammatical
and perfectly meaningful.
Bearing these points in mind, let us suppose for argument’s sake that:
(S)‘‘some phi is psi’’ is to the same effect as ‘‘at least one phi is psi.’’
If S is true, then
(a
2
)‘‘Only some cupcakes are yummy’’
is to the effect as:
(a
2
?)onlythe members of a proper subset of the set of cupcakesorof the entire set of cupcakes in its entirety
are yummy.
So far as a
2
? has a clear meaning, it seems to be to the effect that:
(a
2
?*)at the very least, the following holds: either every member of some proper subset of the set of all cupcakes
are yummy or every member of the set of cupcakes (i.e. of animpropersubset of the set of cupcakes) are
yummy.
But this is obviouslynotwhat a
2
means. The occurrence of ‘‘only’’ in a
2
tells the auditor to take the word ‘‘some’’ at face value;
it tells him, in other words, tointerpret it literally.
3.2.1. The semantics of ‘‘literalizing’’ terms, such as ‘‘only’’, ‘‘at most’’, and ‘‘literally’’
A story will help clarify some of the points just made. While driving together, you and I have the following dialogue:
You:Is there a nearby place to get food?
Me:There’s a McDonalds down the road.
You:Given what you said, it follows that we will soon have access to food, the reason being that food is available at the
nearby McDonalds.’’
J.-M. Kuczynski / Journal of Pragmatics 42 (2010) 2836–28442841

Me:No—that doesn’t follow. Givenonlywhat I said, it could be that the McDonald’s is closed; or it could be that we don’t
have any money, and therefore can’t get food there, even if it’s open.
You:I grant that theonlything yousaid—i.e. that theonlything that, at the level of literal meaning, you affirmed—was that
there was a McDonald’s down the road. But, under the circumstances, I was right to make the inference that it wasn’t
onlythe case that there was a McDonald’s down the road; I was entitled to make the inference that said McDonald’s
would be a source of food.
Me:Yes, you’re right. But so am I. For, as you yourself grant, I saidonlythat there was a McDonald’s down the road; and, as
you yourself grant, given only what my wordsliterallymeant, I left it open whether or not said McDonald’s would be a
place we could get food.
In this story, I’m guilty of violating the usual conversational protocols and, in so doing, I’m being extremely obstreperous. But
from a strictly semantic perspective, my end of the conversation is quite impeccable.
In this conversation, the occurrences of the word ‘‘only’’ are very clearly there to direct you, the auditor, to confine your
attention to theliteral meaningof what I said, and not to read non-literal meanings into what I said.
It is in precisely this way that the occurrence of ‘‘only’’ in a
2
is functioning. In uttering a
2
*, one is unambiguously saying
that all and only the members of apropersubset of the set of all cupcakes are yummy.
Moreover, it would be bad methodology to deny that this was the literal meaning of a
2
. For such a denial would be
tantamount to a denial of the fact that our intuitions (though clearly defeasible, especially in matters relating to semantics)
are to be givensomeweight.
So we must conclude that, at the level of literal meaning, a
2
is to the effect that all andonlythe members of someproper
subset of the set of all cupcakes are yummy. An exactly similar argument holds with respect to a
3
and thus establishes the
very same conclusion.
3.2.2. Why, though semantically redundant, literalizers (e.g. ‘‘only’’, ‘‘literally’’) are not redundant tout court
‘‘But’’, it might be asked, ‘‘doesn’t your analysis entail that the occurrence of ‘only’ in a
2
is redundant and, therefore, that it
is serving no function?’’
My analysis may entail that the aforementioned occurrence issemanticallyredundant. But that doesn’t mean that it is
redundanttout court.(Sometimes what is redundant from the viewpoint of semantics is non-redundant from the viewpoint
of pragmatics. This is one of those times.)
Many expressions are such that their semantic function is to confine the auditor’s attention to literal meaning—are such
their function is to tell the auditor not to draw inferences that go beyond what, at the level of literal meaning, was affirmed.
Among such expression are: ‘‘exactly’’, ‘‘precisely’’, and, indeed, ‘‘literally.’’
The following dialogues will make this clear:
Dialogue #1
Smith:How much money does that guy have?
Jones:He has a billion dollars.
Smith:No, really, how much money does he have?
Jones:Heliterallyhas a billion dollars.
Commentary: Clearly, Jones’ utterance of ‘‘[h]eliterallyhas a billion dollars’’ is to the effect that his previous utterance of ‘‘[h]
e has a billion dollars’’ is to be taken literally.
Dialogue #2:
Smith:How much money does Brown owe to the bank?
Jones:Brown owes $10,000 to the bank.
Smith:I need to knowpreciselyhow much money Brown owes the bank.
Jones:Brown owesprecisely$10,000 to the bank.
Commentary: Clearly, Jones’ utterance of Brown owesprecisely$10,000 to the bank’’ is to the effect that his previous
utterance of Brown owes $10,000 to the bank.’’ is to be taken literally.
Dialogue #3:
Smith:When were human beings first able to talk?
Jones:Human beings were first able to talk 100,000 years ago.
Smith:I need to knowexactlyhow when were human beings first able to talk.
Jones:
J.-M. Kuczynski / Journal of Pragmatics 42 (2010) 2836–28442842

Human beings were first able to talkexactly100,000 years ago. In other words, whatever today’s date is, and whatever
the exact moment was at which I uttered the previous sentence, subtract 100,000 from that, and that will give you the
time—the exact time—when people first spoke.
Commentary: The same as last time,mutatis mutandis.
A conversation of any length or depth that consisted of statements all of which were to be taken literally would
be very different from any actually conversation. Much of what is communicated is not what is literally meant by our
words, and is instead (non-literally) suggested. (It is through ‘‘conversational implicatures’’, to use H.P. Grice’s now
standard term, that we do much of our communicating.) But sometimes we want our words to be interpreted narrowly;
we don’t want people to read extra-semantic meanings into them. It should therefore be no surprise that language
contains devices whose very purpose is to make it clear that the utterances in whose scope they fall are to be taken
literally.
4. Why points #4 and #5 are correct
These same dialogues make it clear that numerals mean exactly what they seem to mean. (They make it clear that
‘‘10,000’’ means10,000: notat least 10,000orapproximately 10,000.) And the way in which these dialogues makes this clear is
very similar to the way in which they make it clear that ‘‘some’’ meanssome, as opposed toat least some (and possibly all)).
Here we need only repeat what we said a moment ago, making a few adjustments along the way.
Consider the following sentences:
(b
1
)‘‘Brown owes $10,000 to the bank.’’
(b
2
)‘‘Brown owesprecisely$10,000 to the bank.’’
(b
3
)‘‘Brown owesat most$10,000 to the bank.’’
(b
4
)‘‘Brown owes at least $10,000 (i.e. he either owes exactly that amount or he owes more).’’
For argument’s sake, suppose that ‘‘10,000’’ means ‘‘at least 10,000’’, and make the correlative supposition that the literal
meaning of b
1
is to the same effect as the literal meaning of b
2
. In that case, b
2
is to the same effect as the sentence (or, in any
case, sentence-like expression):
(b
2
?)‘‘Brown owespreciselyat least $10,000 to the bank.’’
So far as b
2
? has a clear meaning, it seems to be to the effect that:
(b
2
?*)the following is unqualifiedly (literally, technically, etc.) correct:eitherBrown owes $10,000 to the bank
(and not a penny less)orhe owes more than $10,000 to the bank.
But b
2
?* clearly isn’t what b
2
means. b
2
says that Brown owes $10,000 to the bank: not one penny more and not one penny
less. An exactly similar argument holds with respect to b
4
and thus establishes the very same conclusion, viz. that ‘‘10,000’’
means10,000: notat least 10,000orroughly 10,000.
Duly generalized, this argument establishes that, for any numeral n, n meansn: notat least norroughlyn. Thus, Point #4 is
correct; and Point #5 is also correct, given that #5 is obviously an immediate consequence of #4.
4.1. A similar argument
Consider the following argument/sentence:
(^)Given that Smith has seven cars, he has an odd number of cars.
If ‘‘seven’’ meantat least seven, then ^ would not express a valid argument. But it clearly does express a valid argument.
In response to this, one could take the position that, at the level of literal meaning, ^ does not convey a valid argument and
that, to the extent that tokens of itcommunicatesuch an argument, it is by the grace of implicatures. But there is no
independent support for such a position, which is an implausible one and for the negation of which we’ll now provide
additional support.
In the sentence
(*)‘‘5 + 5 = 10’’
the number-expressions (numerals) are, or at least appear to be, functioning as substantives (nouns). (The occurrences of ‘‘5’’
and ‘‘10’’ seem to be synonymous with, respectively, ‘‘the number 5’’ and ‘‘the number 10’’; and, of course, those definite
descriptions are noun-phrases.)
J.-M. Kuczynski / Journal of Pragmatics 42 (2010) 2836–28442843

But in the sentence
(**)‘‘5 things plus 5 other things add up toexactly10 things.’’
those same numerals are functioning as adjectives.
That said, * and ** have extremely similar meanings. But if the occurrences in ** of ‘‘5’’ meantat least five, then, even
though * is true, ** would be false, a consequence being * and ** had different meanings. * is indisputably to the effect that 5
+5= exactly10; but, given its similarity in respect of meaning to **, * would NOT be to that effect IF ‘‘5’’ meant ‘‘at least five.’’
A similar argument: consider the sentence:
(***)If Jim has five cars in Idaho, and he has five cars in Florida, and he has no other cars besides those just mentioned, then,
Jim has exactly ten cars altogether.
*** is correct. (We’re assuming that none of Jim’s Idaho-cars is numerically identical with any of his Florida-cars.) But if the
occurrences in *** of ‘‘5’’ meantat leastfive, *** would be false.
So ‘‘5’’ means what it seems to mean. It meansfive: notat least fiveorroughly five.The same line of reasoningmutatis
mutandisholds for any given numeral n. Thus, point #5 is correct. We have thus established the truth of Points #1–#5.
