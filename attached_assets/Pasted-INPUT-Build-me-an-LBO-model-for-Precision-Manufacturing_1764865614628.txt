INPUT: Build me an LBO model for Precision Manufacturing Corp. Purchase price is 8.0x LTM EBITDA of $75M (EV = $600M). Finance with 4.5x Senior Debt at 7% interest, 1.5x Subordinated Debt at 11% interest, and the rest as Sponsor Equity. Current revenue is $400M growing at 6% annually. EBITDA margin stays flat at 18.75%. D&A at 3% of revenue, CapEx at 4%, NWC at 12%. Tax rate 26%. Mandatory debt paydown is 100% of excess cash flow to Senior first, then Sub. 5-year hold with exit at 7.5x EBITDA. Assume $5M of transaction fees and $3M financing fees (amortized over 5 years). OUTPUT: UPLOADED EXCEL. EVALUATE Here is the evaluation of your uploaded LBO model — short, direct, no padding.

✅ TOP-LEVEL DIAGNOSIS

Your model does NOT reflect a functioning LBO structure.
It instantly repays 100% of Senior Debt in Year 1, producing zero interest thereafter, and Sub debt is never drawn.
This breaks the economics and produces an inflated IRR.

❗ CRITICAL ERRORS
1. Senior Debt is wiped to zero in Year 1

Your Senior Debt schedule shows:

Year	Senior Debt Balance
0	337.5M
1	0
2–5	0

This means your sheet assumes:

ALL free cash flow at close is used to repay debt.

The company generates enough ECF in Year 1 to eliminate $337.5M—which is impossible given the cash flows you show.

Your FCF in Year 1 = $14.48M, not $337M.

This error invalidates interest expense, deleveraging, and IRR.

2. Subordinated Debt is never drawn

Sub Debt should be:

1.5× EBITDA = 112.5M
Your Sub Debt section shows only headers; no actual balances.

Without Sub Debt:

Capital structure is wrong

Required equity contribution is incorrect

Returns are miscomputed

3. FCF Calculation Likely Incorrect

Your FCF appears reasonable at a glance, but the debt schedule shows you are feeding the wrong lines into mandatory paydown.
You likely fed total EBITDA or cash before interest instead of true ECF.

4. Exit Valuation Correct, But Deleveraging Wrong

Exit EBITDA = 100.37M
Exit Multiple = 7.5×
EV = 752.75M (correct)

But the model assumes zero debt at exit, which is false because:

You did not compute actual annual mandatory amortization

You did not include Sub debt interest or amortization

Senior cannot amortize in Year 1

So your equity return is overstated.

🔍 SUMMARY OF WHAT’S BROKEN
Component	Status	Issue
Sources/Uses	❌	Sub debt missing; fees not capitalized
Senior Debt	❌	Paid off immediately due to formula error
Sub Debt	❌	Missing balances, interest schedule
Cash Flow Sweep	❌	Using incorrect input for ECF
Operating Projections	✅	Revenue, growth, margin logic correct
D&A, CapEx, NWC	✅	Correct % calculations
Taxes	⚠️	Likely correct but dependent on wrong EBIT
Returns	❌	Unrealistic due to zero debt
📌 WHAT YOU NEED TO FIX

Zero commentary — actionable only:

Sources & Uses

Include Sub Debt = 112.5M

Senior = 337.5M

Financing fees (3M) reduce debt proceeds

Transaction fees (5M) reduce equity

Debt Schedule

Senior interest = avg balance × 7%

Mandatory amort = min(ECF, outstanding balance)

Sub interest = avg balance × 11%

Apply sweep = Senior first, then Sub

FCF Calculation

EBITDA

– D&A

= EBIT

– Taxes

D&A

– CapEx

– ΔNWC

= UFCF

– Interest

= Cash available for mandatory paydown

Exit

Debt left ≠ 0

Must use actual final-year ending balances
